## An Age of Mission

**One** _Introduction_

- Catholic maritime powers in western Europe expanded trade to Africa, India and Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries (1490s-1500s)
- Now, During this period, Catholicism spread to these regions through Portuguese and Spanish missionaries
- Missionary work was coordinated at national level by different societies
  Example: Société des Missions Etrangères de Paris, which was influential in Indo-China

**Two** _The development of missionary work in the 17th century_

- In the seventeenth century, Pope Gregory XV created a central authority for missionary work, and Pope Urban VIII founded a training college for missionaries at Rome
- This new approach to missionary work highlighted its religious nature and the scientific and linguistic education of missionaries
- This prepared the way for the creation of an indigenous clergy in the Americas, Africa, and Asia

**Three** _The reasons for the development of the missionary work in the 17th century_

- One reason for the development of missionary work was the need for central coordination by religious authorities, rather than national churches
- Another reason was the concern that some Catholic nations were more interested in economic interests than in spreading the faith
- A third reason was the realization that Protestantism was expanding its missionary endeavors, threatening the global dominance of Catholicism

**Four** _The contrast between Protestant and Catholic mission in the 16h and 17th centuries_

- Protestantism focused on defending its communities against enemies, whether Protestant or Catholic
- Catholicism made significant inroads in many parts of South America, Africa, and Asia due to the voyages of discovery of the Portuguese and Spanish navigators

**Five** _The development of Protestant mission in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries_

- Protestantism developed an interest in mission by the beginning of the long nineteenth century, spreading through trading links, colonial activity, and intentional outreach
- Great Britain played an important role in missionary work, as it became a global power with colonies throughout the world
- Protestant maritime powers, such as Holland and England, gained confidence, while Catholic missionary agencies lost confidence in the eighteenth century as a result of the papal suppression of the Society of Jesus, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic wars
- But by the second half of the nineteenth century, Catholicism recovered its confidence and focused on mission again

**Six** _The recent scholarly attention to the history of Christian missions_

- Roughly before 1990, studies of missions were largely written by retired missionaries with their own biases and agenda
- Also, Secular scholarship often viewed missionary work as an aspect of imperial history, missionaries were seen as puppets of their nations, mainly committed to the expansion of thier country's agenda vis a vis power and influence

  Imperialism :

  - The idea that one's country is superior to another.
  - In Practical terms, the expanding or extending of a nations power and influence over other nations
