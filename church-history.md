## Creeds are :
- > authorized, consensual and public statements of essential christian belief.

## The Council debates emphasized the need for creeds. 
Reasons:
 * To have a consistent 'Traditional' theology
    - Tradition - 'Hand over or hand on (to) or hand down'
    - These 'Tranditions' were to be the Apostles' Traditions
    - and these 'Traditions' were more of orthodoxy (correct teachings) rather than Orthopraxis (correct conduct)
    - the scriptural basis for a 'Traditional' creed can be found in 1 Corinthians 15:3â€“4 :
    - > "I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures"
        
    * To combat heresies
    * Political reason - (Constatine) which was to have a unified belief system to unite the roman empire


## Two popular Creeds eventually emerged
The Apostles' Creed :
- > this creed which is believed to be the earliest was formulated -
    * not by a council or imperial authority
    * not through polemics (i.e. argument or debates)
    * but by general consensus by the local churches over extended period of time
    * the various parts of the creed are seen in the recitals of early baptismal practices
    * this creed derives its name from the belief that each of the 12 apostles contributed to the text
    
The Niceno Constatinopolitan Creed (Nicene Creed) :
- > this creed was formulated by
    * a council under imperial authority though not vitoed or influenced by it
    * was highly polemical
    * Shaped by Arianism
    * the creed concludes with a condemnation of Arianian theological position
    * also Alister McGrath believes it is somewhat longer than necessary

Theme and Functions
- >
    -  the dorminant theme is 'belief in' not 'belief that'
    -  also the creeds affirm - the fundamental themes of faith and
    - offer a framework to define heresy


## The Need for the Council of Chalcedon
 After a clear theological formular was deduced and publicly declared, new  controversies arose after the Nicene council. 
- > Controversies :
    1. the Bishop from the most important metropolitan, Constatinople gave support to Arius (or Arian) but emperor Theodosius deposed the bishop to enforce the Nicene Orthodoxy
    2. Another controversy arose b/n Cyril (Patriarch of Alexandria) and Nestorius (Patriarch of Constantinople) known as Nestorian Controversy
        - Nestorius expressed reservations about the term 'Theotokos' used for Mary and proposed Christotokos
        - Nestorius lost the debate at the council of Ephesus as well as his bishopric

After that, more controversies arose in relation to the identity of Jesus which gave the need to assemble the council of Chalcedon
-  the council set out a formular for the identity of Jesus, safeguarding his human identity whiles affirming his divinity :

    - > "Following the holy Fathers, we all with one voice confess our Lord Jesus Christ to be one and the same Son, perfect in divinity and humanity, truly God and truly human, consisting of a rational soul and a body, being of one substance with the Father in relation to his divinity, and being of one substance with us in relation to his humanity, and is like us in all things apart from sin."

Finally, the Chalcedon council also gave rise to another Controversy known as "monophysitism"  - its concern was that the Chalcedon Council failed to defend properly the identity of Christ
