## Divine Simplicity

Terms to define:

- Aseity :

* the state or nature or quality of the divine to exist or originate from Itself or
* the state or quality to being self-derived or self-originated

- Absoluteness :

* the nature of God by which He is not conditioned by anything external to Himself

- Perichoresis

- Univocal, Equivocal and analogical

- Necessary and Contingent Being

- Quiddity
- Genus

Ibn Sina's further conclusions: it is not
possible for God to have a logical definition, since a logical
definition is composed of a genus and a differentia. Since it
is impossible for God to be caused, we can never demonstrate His existence through His cause
