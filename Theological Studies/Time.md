## Personal development of what time is

- Time is the metrical value placed on the change of events - this could easily be flawed with question of 'What then is event' or 'Change of event over what? time?'

- Time is the difference or metrical value of the difference of instances - this seems more solid than the 1st definition
**NB** Please define _instance_
