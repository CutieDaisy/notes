## Personal development of what time is

- Time is the metrical value placed on the change of events - this could easily be flawed with question of 'What then is event' or 'Change of event over what? time?'

- Time is the difference or metrical value of the difference of instances - this seems more solid than the 1st definition
**NB** Please define _instance_

Views of Time :
Relational view - related to event i.e. before and after
Substantival view - time is a substance


Some relationalists may pursue some sort of Reductionist program

Temporal - temporal location and temporal duration 
Timelessness : not temporal

If something began to exist then it is preceded by non-existence
