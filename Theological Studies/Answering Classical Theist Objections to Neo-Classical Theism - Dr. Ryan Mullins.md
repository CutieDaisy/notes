## Answering Classical Theist Objections to Neo-Classical Theism | Dr. Ryan Mullins

# Part 2: The 'Prisoner of Time Objection' :

The objection is raised by Paul Helm (AI Gen -> in his 1999 book 'The Prisoner of Time')
**Objection to the 'Prisoner of time Objection'** :

- The objection seem to be begging the question bcs it assumes that perfection entails timelessness or that timelessness is a property of perfection. It is pointed out by Paul Helm himself that timelessness is equal to perfection which he shld avoid bcs it's begging the question.
- Or it is assuming that the single superabundant experience of God (i.e. the experience of God before the universe was created) is timeless which can be argued otherwise as temporal

- Or if it is the case that the superabundant experience is timeless and not temporal, then it assumes that time exist only if there is a change in succession (of events) i.e. assuming what is called Relational or Reductive theory of time - _Here Ryan Mullins notes that this theory is incoherent or circular (but he doesn't explain)_.
  * Circular Reasoning if time is only a change of succession - 
    if time is a measure of change, then what does the change occur over or change over what? or if time is merely the change of events then what is an event?

* Proposed Theory against Reductive theory of Time
  **Absolute Theory of Time**

  - Time is an attribute of God. This theory was held by:
    i. Sir Isaac Newton
    ii. Ragunatha Shiromani (Hindu Philosopher)
    iii. TF Torrence also seems to affirm this view (Not Sure)

  - Within the Absolute view, one ought to distinguish between Time and the moments of time
    - Moment of Time - How things are but could be subsequently ( i.e. the next moment) otherwise
    - Hence succession and change occur over a series of moments i.e. change and succession does not take place at a moment but over a series of moments
    - If time is then the change or succession over a series of moments then there is no time at a moment - which Dr. Mullins points out is weird and that time is more fundamental than moments of time.
    - He argues that change and succession are not essential features of time but of a series of moments
    - Unique to this view of time, is the idea from Dr Mullins that the series of moments does not necessary move forward. This idea holds that God can decide to freeze time or annihilate the universe entirely and go back in existing in a single solitary state by Himself

**12:53**

- What then is time? Some say time is a natured entity or an uncaused substance and that is responsible for certain features of reality. Some of these features are:

* It is responsible for making change possible
* it the source of moments
* it make things exist at the present and
* it unifies a series of moments
  Dr Mullins notes that if these features are true of time, then time is a property of God and if so then the 'Prisoner of Time' objection is invalid since God is not a prisoner of any of his attributes or properties or his essence.
