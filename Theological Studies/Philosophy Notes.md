Calvinist view - Freedom is compatible with being causally determined i.e. free will is compatible with being determined. Freedom here is reason's account of freedom i.e where one act on account of reasons i.e. you do the things you want to do even though God causes you to do the actions you do.

What is free will? Being the source of your actions and the ability to do otherwise
(Not everyone agrees with the second part of the statement i.e. the ability to do otherwise)

Antecedence

John Polkinghorne
Karl Barth
Hans Urs von Balthasar - “theological aesthetics” rather than an “aesthetic theology.” i.e. We do not approach God through beauty; rather, God approaches us through the beauty of Christ.


Epistemic Distance - this means that God is not as obvious as He could be. The idea here is that, if God makes Himself too obvious then we would be coerced to acknowledge his existence and have a relationship with Him

Views on God's Causal Power :
Occasionalism,
Concurrence,
Mere Conservation - this is the view that God create the universe, give creatures genuine causal power and sustains them in existence


Omnipotence - 
The ability to do anything that is logically, ontological and metaphysically possible for God. Or
The ability to have the most power granting set of abilities with no liabilities or weaknesses - Ryan Mullins
