Emotion is a felt evaluation of a situation with comprises or involves of cognitive and affective components
    Cognitive - the way you are mentally represent the (things in your) situation or basically he mental representation or evaluation of the world
    Affective - What it feels like to have the emotion

How does these connect to truth and morality :
* Your emotions are likely to be corrected in the ff ways :
 **Truth**
    - Your evaluation could be entirely false
    - The evaluation could be truth but exaggerated 
 **Morality**
    - 

* Impassibility
    Claims:
    - It is impossible for God to suffer
    - It is impossible for God to be moved by anything outside of Himself
    - God can have any emotion that is consistent with his :
         * perfect rationality, 
         * perfect Goodness and 
         * perfect happiness

    Counter Claims :
    - It is possible for God to suffer
    - It is possible for God to be moved by somethings outside of Himself
    - God can have any emotion that is consistent with his :
         * perfect rationality, and 
         * perfect Goodness
         * But not always consistent with His happiness - because sometimes the rational and good response is to be angry or not to be happy
         NB: Part of what it means to be rational is to respond appropriately to values or reasons

Why would God Create?
- Classical Theist claims God is the perfect realiza of all possible values or all possible good. So there is no possible way to create more values or goodness bcs Gd has already realized it. Hence there is no reason to create the universe at all.
- Passibilist - God is the greatest possible good but there are certain values or good that God cannot realize by Himself - like creator-creature relationship (friendship with creatures). God has all the power and potencies possible
