## The Spanish Civil War (1936â€“9)

**Introduction** _Spain's political turmoil in the 19th century_

- Spain remained a Catholic nation despite the Peninsular War and its aftermath
- Spain briefly became a republic in 1873 after the king abdicated, but the monarchy was soon restored
- However, Republicanism gained momentum and became popular after WWI,
- Although spain was not in involve in the War, it still took a toll on Spain's economy despite its neutrality

**One** _Spain's transition to the Second Republic and its challenges_

- After a military coup and the king's abdication, Spain elected a republican government in 1931
- The new government introduced reforms that reduced the power and influence of the Catholic church, which angered many conservatives
- Monarchists, Falangists and other right-wing groups clashed with the republicans, socialists and radicals, causing violence and unrest

**Two** _The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War_

- A left-wing coalition of republicans, secularists, and communists won the 1936 elections, increasing the tension with the right-wing factions
- General Franco, a conservative military leader, planned a coup to overthrow the government from his base in Spanish Morocco
- The coup began in July 1936 and quickly seized control of parts of Spain, triggering a civil war that lasted until 1939

**Three** _The international involvement in the Spanish Civil War_

- Germany and the Soviet Union used the war as a testing ground for their weapons and strategies, sometimes with devastating effects on civilians. (A case in piont was the bombing of the Basque village of Guernica in April 1937)
- The Republicans received aid from the Soviet Union, Mexico, and foreign volunteers who joined the International Brigades
- The Nationalists received aid from Germany, Italy, and Portugal

**Four** _The religious dimension of the Spanish Civil War_

- The Republicans wanted to secularize Spain and limit the influence of the Catholic church, which they saw as a reactionary force
- The Nationalists defended the Catholic faith and tradition, and portrayed themselves as the protectors of Christian civilization
- Both sides committed atrocities, but the Republicans were especially brutal in their persecution of Catholics, which has led historians to suggest that the atrocities committed were the most extensive and violent persecution of Catholicism in western history, in some ways
  being even more intense than that of the French Revolution

**Five** _The aftermath of the Spanish Civil War for Catholicism_

- The Republicans had attacked Catholicism violently during the 1934 uprising and the Civil War, provoking the Nationalists to rally around the Catholic cause
- The Nationalists had strong Catholic ties and beliefs, and saw themselves as fighting against communism and anarchy
- The Nationalists won the war in 1939, ending the anti-Catholic policies of the Republicans and restoring the privileged status of the Catholic church in Spain

**Five** _The broader context of anti-Christian movements in Europe_

- The Russian Revolution of 1917 inspired many radicals in Europe to pursue revolutionary agendas, which often clashed with established churches
- These movements wanted to secularize society and limit the role and influence of Christianity in public life
- They implemented measures such as secularizing education, cutting state funding for churches, removing religious symbols, and discriminating against clergy and religious orders

**Six** _The significance of the Spanish Civil War_

- The Spanish Civil War was a testing ground for the German military, which used it to develop new tactics and weapons that would be used in the Second World War
- The Second World War was a devastating conflict that killed millions of people and reshaped Europe
- WW2 created a post-war Europe that was more hostile to Christianity, especially in the eastern regions that fell under communist influence
