## The Wars of Religion

Calvinism's began to expand rapidly in France during the 1550s and it was secretly supported and funded by Geneva.
The rapid growth of Calvinism sparked what is known as the French Wars of Religion (1562–98).

During this period, Geneva sent reformed pastors to cities and congregations across France through a hidden network and safe houses in Provence.

Calvinism spread rapidly in France, reaching 1785 reformed congregations by 1562. Many French nobles embraced Calvin’s ideas and became Protestants (or “Huguenots”). However, this provoked hostility from the Catholic majority.
The Duke of Guise’s massacred a Huguenot congregation at Wassy in March 1562 which marked the start of the hostilities.
Another horrific event was the “Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre” in August 1572, when about 10 000 French Protestants were killed.

The first half of the seventeenth century saw 2 of the most important religious wars.
one was between different types of Protestantism, and the other between Protestantism and Catholicism.

The first of these wars was a conflict between King Charles I and the Parliament over religious and political issues. Charles I tried to rule without Parliament for 11 years, but had to summon it again in 1640 to raise money for the war against Scotland. But Parliament challenged the king’s authority and his Catholic sympathies, and also parliament executed some of his supporters for treason (eg. Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford 1593–1642), eventually winning the war against the king.

What happened was : One John Pym (1584–1643) led a parliamentary revolt in 1641 against Charles’s plan to raise an army for the Irish war or rebellion. John feared that the King would use the army to crush his oponents in England first. For this concern, Parliament issued what is termed “Grand Remonstrance” (basically meaning a protest) listing their complaints against the King. It impeached twelve bishops, and even tried to impeach the queen (Henrietta Maria of France – a Catholic). Charles I attempted to arrest Pym and four of his supporters in the House of Commons but failed making matters worse leading to the English Civil War in August 1642.

The Puritan victory in the war did not last long politically, and Anglicanism soon regained its religious dominance after a brief and ineffective period of Puritan rule. Other conflicts within Protestantism may not have been as violent or warlike, but they were real and unsolvable.
Protestantism became a house divided against itself – regionally, culturally, and theologically

The Thirty Years War from 1618 to 1648 was a religious and civil war in Germany that involved Lutheran, Reformed, and Catholic regions and countries. The war started for religious reasons, but other factors also played a role in causing and extending it. It is considered one of the worst events in modern European history. Many regions lost a lot of people and faced economic ruin because of this long and pointless war between Protestants and Catholics. The results of this war were disappointing for everyone involved.

The Peace of Westphalia (1648) ended the war and the desire for religious warfare. People wanted peace and toleration, and were tired of religious disputes. The Enlightenment idea that religion should be a private matter, not a state matter, was ready to emerge.

Western European culture changed dramatically, as reason replaced faith as the dominant force.After the Puritan failure, the English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704) said that the main reason for men to form governments was to protect their property. This prepared the way for a more secular Europe.
