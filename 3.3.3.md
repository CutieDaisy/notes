## A Breif History of Huldrych Zwingli

- Huldrych Zwingli also known as Ulrich Zwingli was a Swiss reformer who played a major role in developing the reformation movement within the Swiss Confederation, especially in Zurich.

- He was born on January 1st, 1484, in Toggenburg Valley in St. Gallen canton.

- Although St. Gallen was not part of the Swiss Confederation at a point in time, Zwingli always regarded himself as a Swiss. However, St. Gallen later allied itself to some of the Swiss member states (cantons) in the treaty of 1451.

- He studied at the University of Vienna between 1498 and 1502 which was considered and noted as one of the most exiting universities in relation to reforms

- Zwingli was a humanist who served as a priest at Glarus for ten years before moving to serve as "people's priest" at the Benedictine monastery at Einsiedeln in 1516.

- His humanistic position was very much influenced and guided by humanists such as Conrad Celtis while at the University of Vienna. After moving from Vienna, he strengthened his humanist position while studying at the University of Basel from 1502-6.

- Zwingli served as a chaplain to Swiss mercenary soldiers in the Franco-Italian war. He was present at the disaster of Marignano (1515) - where large numbers of Swiss mercenary soldiers died.
  The Battle of Marignano (Melegnano) :
  "The Battle of Marignano was fought during the Italian Wars between France and the Old Swiss Confederacy on September 13 and 14, 1515. The French army won the battle against the Swiss Confederacy. The battle was fought near a town called Melegnano in Italy. The French victory at Marignano was an important event in Europe's history. The war ended Swiss dominance in European warfare and established France as a major power in Europe"

- Zwingli had always oppose the trade of mercenaries but increased his opposition more so after having witness the large number of mercenary deaths during the Swiss war.
  This was fundamental in the development of what is called - the Swiss isolationism in the sixteenth century.
  The Swiss Isolationism: is the policy or decision of the Swiss to take no part in other nations’ or international affairs.

- Zwingli became convinced of the need for reform of the church which was to be patterned after some biblical humanists such as Erasmus.

- He purchased Erasmus's edition of the Greek New Testament and also studied the writings of both Greek and Latin early Christian authors. By the time he left Einsiedeln ( “INE-see-deln”) for Zurich, Zwingli had become convinced that Christian belief and practice must be based on Scripture, not human traditions.

- Zwingli became a "people's priest" at the Great Minster in Zurich on January 1, 1519. He began preaching a course of sermons on Matthew's gospel and ignored the conventional lectionary altogether. 

- He nearly died in the same year (1519), during an outbreak of the plague at Zurich in the summer. This close brush with death made him rethink how God intervenes in human affairs, which helped him shape his views on divine providence.

- He began to challenged the Catholic Church in Zurich. In 1522-1523, he preached against many Catholic practices and beliefs, such as fasting, the cult of saints, and the worship of Mary. 

- His preaching caused conflict and unrest in the city. So The city council decided to have a public debate between Zwingli and his Catholic opponents to settle the matter.

- During the debate with some local Catholic clergy, it soon became obvious what the outcome will be - Zwingli had the advantage over his rivals. He could easily switch from Hebrew, Greek, or Latin to the local language of Zurich and he knew the Bible better than anyone else. The result was obvious. The City Council agreed to follow Zwingli’s plan of reform based on Scripture as the official city policy.

- The Mass was banned by Zurich city council in 1525 and replaced with Zwingli’s version of the Lord’s Supper. His view of the eucharist was very different and caused a lot of controversy. He also thought that the Lord’s Supper was a way of commemorating Christ’s death while he was not present - which is known as the “memorialist” view

- Finally, Zwingli's reforms spread to other cities through public debates. In 1528, Bern, a powerful city, joined the Reformation. This helped Geneva and Calvin later in 1536. Zwingli died in 1531 while fighting for his cause.
