## The Post-Reformation Era

The Reformation transformed religion, society, and politics in western Europe.
This section explores how the Reformation led to the reformulation of certain basic tenets of Christianity resulting in the division of Western Christendom.

After John Calvin died in 1564, Protestantism changed to adapt to the political situation in Europe. Many rulers tried to avoid religious conflicts by enforcing one official church in their lands. For example, Elizabeth I made herself the head of the Church of England and banned other religions.

This was also happening in other parts of Europe, like Germany in the late 1500s. This was called “Confessionalization” or “the Second Reformation.” It meant that each region had one religion based on a set of official beliefs (a “Confession of Faith”) that everyone had to follow. The church in charge of this religion answered to the ruler or the government.

People wanted clear and legal rules for beliefs and practices. So “state churches” were created, which made society more united. This was like the medieval idea of Christendom, but on a smaller scale. Each region had its own version of Christianity. They all agreed on the Bible and creeds, but they also had their own “Confessions of Faith” to show their differences.

Protestant “state churches” started in Germany in the 1570s. They had some benefits, but they also tied the church to political power. This could make the church less honest. It also led to religious wars, because religion and nationality were linked. People’s beliefs depended on their state.
