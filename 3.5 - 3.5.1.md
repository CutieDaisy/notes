## The Post-Reformation Era

The Reformation transformed religion, society, and politics in western Europe.
This section explores how the Reformation led to the reformulation of certain basic tenets of Christianity resulting in the division of Western Christendom.

After John Calvin died in 1564, Protestantism changed to adapt to the political situation in Europe. Many rulers tried to avoid religious conflicts by enforcing one official church in their lands. For example, Elizabeth I made herself the head of the Church of England and banned other religious alternatives.

This was also happening in other parts of Europe, like Germany in the late 1500s. This was called “Confessionalization” or “the Second Reformation.” It meant that each region had one religion based on a set of official beliefs (a “Confession of Faith”) that everyone had to follow. The church in charge of this religion answered to the ruler or the government.

People wanted clear and legal rules for beliefs and practices. So “state churches” were created, which made society more united. This was like the medieval idea of Christendom, but on a smaller scale. Each region had its own version of Christianity. They all agreed on the Bible and creeds, but they also had their own “Confessions of Faith” to show their differences.

Protestant “state churches” started in Germany in the 1570s. They had some benefits, but they also tied the church to political power. This potentially made the church less honest. It also led to religious wars, because religion and nationality were linked. People’s beliefs depended on their state.

Things that used to be unimportant for religion became important to separate Protestant churches. Lutherans and Calvinists looked for differences and made them bigger. These differences also became political, because the state wanted to control its people better.

Calvinism was becoming more popular than Lutheranism in western Europe by the 1590s. Lutherans had to now fight against both Catholics and Calvinists. Both groups used doctrines to show their identity. The Heidelberg Catechism (1563) became an influencial Calvinist teaching tool developed in Germany. It taught Calvin’s theology and criticized Lutherans and Catholics.

Lutheran and Reformed churches in Germany fought over who was the true Reformation church. They looked the same in society and politics, but they had different doctrines. They used doctrines to show their differences. They did not see themselves as part of one Protestant family, but as rivals for land and power.

The Bible as we know was very important for Protestants, but they started to read it in the light of their own confessions. They used “confessions” - statements of faith - to tell them what the Bible meant without looking at the whole context of the scriptures. This made the Bible less powerful in Protes-tan-tism, because it was not allowed to shape or question their beliefs.

Because of that, Lutherans and Calvinists wanted to show how they were different from each other. They argued a lot about two things: predestination and the “real presence.” - These were about how God chooses people and what happens in communion.
