Christian humanists of the Renaissance era were concerned for the renewal and reform of the church. They applied the same method of regeneration to Christianity by returning to the original sources of faith, the Bible, especially the New Testament.

To ensure that this was effective, They had to make sure that the writings of medieval theologians were set aside to allow a direct engagement with the ideas of the New Testament.

- This kind of idea was a powerful vision for many lay people in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.

- Now there were 2 very important themes that the Renaissance held and brought to reshaped Christianity.

  - The first was a strong criticism of scholasticism, which humanist authors regarded as impeding access to early Christian writers such as Augustine of Hippo.
  - The second was a return to the New Testament, which Renaissance Christian writers regarded as the title-deed of Christianity, and insisted that theology and spirituality should be based on a direct engagement with this text, preferably in its original Greek.

- Moreover, the humanists insisted that the Bible should be studied systematically on the basis of the best possible scholarship.

  - This posses 2 challenges:

    - 1st, the actual content of the Bible would have to be established by the most reliable textual methods, and it would have to be read in its original languages.
    - 2nd, by doing so, the authority of the Latin Vulgate translation will come under intense scrutiny as humanist began to examine the history of the text in detail.

  - Now, as the Vulgate text was compared with the best Greek manuscripts, errors began to be noticed. So, in 1516, Erasmus produced an edition of the Greek text of the New Testament, which challenged the Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible, raising questions about some key church doctrines.

    - Erasmus was a Christian Dutch philosopher and scholar who is widely considered to have been one of the greatest scholars of the northern Renaissance. He was a proponent of religious tolerance and was critical of the Catholic Church. He was born in Rotterdam in 1466 and was ordained in 1492.

  - Some of the key areas that were challenged by Erasmus' edition of the bible were:

    - One,
      1 John 5:7â€“8 - "For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree as one".

    * But Erasmus argues that the words "the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth" are not found in any Greek manuscript but were added probably after 800
    * The most likely explanation is that these words were initially added as a brief comment alongside or above the text, which a later scribe assumed to be part of the text itself, and thus included in later Latin texts, unaware that they were not part of the original Greek text of the New Testament

    - Another thing that was challenged by Erasmus was Matthew 4:17 -
      Vulgate: "do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
      Erasmus: "repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"

    - Another was Ephesians 5:31-2 -
      - the vulgate speaks of marriage as a sacrament
      - but Erasmus points out that the word in the greek is 'mysterion' meaning mystery and not sacrament
      - therefore the classical text to justify the inclusion of marriage as a sacrament was rendered problematic

* So, we can say that Humanism used new hermeneutical techniques forcing a radical reform of the church than anyone had anticipated.

* Finally Protestant will use humanist schorlarship to propose key changes in Christian belief and practices
