## Existentialism: a philosophy of human experience

**Introduction - Basic Facts**

- Humans are different from other forms of life because they are aware of their own existence and ask questions about it
- Existentialism is a philosophy that responds to this awareness and challenges the view that humans are "things"
- Existentialism emphasizes the importance and seriousness of personal existence and individual choice


**Existentialism: a philosophy of human life**

- Existentialism can mean or be understood in two ways
    - As an attitude that focuses on the real-life experience and finitude of individuals,
    - As a movement that emerged from the writings of Kierkegaard and Heidegger
- Kierkegaard emphasized the importance of individual choice and the limits of human existence
- Heidegger's _Being and Time_ influenced the development of Christian existentialism by Bultmann, who applied existentialist concepts to the gospel message


**Bultmann's two modes of human existence**: 

- Bultmann builds on Heidegger's distinction between inauthentic and authentic existence, and applies it to the New Testament's view of human life
- Inauthentic existence is when humans ignore their dependence on God and try to secure their own existence through worldly means, which is sin
- Authentic existence is when humans trust in God and his grace, and accept their finitude and mortality, which are overcome by Christ's death and resurrection

**Historical roots of Existentialism**: 

- Existentialism is a modern philosophy that emphasizes the inner world of human experience
- However, this concern with human experience is not new; it can be traced back to the Old and New Testaments, and the writings of Augustine and Luther
- Romanticism also contributed to the interest in human experience and feeling, especially in relation to Christian life
