The Seventeenth-Century Lutheran Debate on Christ's Divinity and Humanity

**Bullet Points:**

- **Early 17th Century:** Lutheran theologians from **Giessen and Tübingen** universities debated Christ's use of divine attributes on earth.
- **Krypsis vs. Kenosis:** Tübingen defended **krypsis** (Christ used divine powers in secret), while Giessen advocated for **kenosis** (Christ did not use divine powers at all).
- **Agreement on Divinity:** Both sides agreed Christ held divine attributes like **omnipotence** and **omnipresence** during incarnation.
- **19th Century Shift:** Growing appreciation for Jesus' humanity, seen as a new religious fact inspiring faith, as stated by **Alois E. Biedermann**.
- **Influence of German Pietism:** Ideas rooted in **Nikolaus von Zinzendorf's** writings, emphasizing a personal relationship with Christ.
- **Schleiermacher's Contribution:** He expanded on Zinzendorf's ideas, focusing on Christ's role in assimilating believers into his fellowship.
- **Theological Dilemmas:** Emphasizing Jesus' humanity raised questions about the neglect of his divinity within orthodox circles.
- **Kenoticism Emergence:** In the late 1850s, **Gottfried Thomasius** promoted kenoticism, balancing the defense of Christ's divinity with an emphasis on his humanity.

Thomasius's Radical Kenotic Christology and Its Reception

**Bullet Points:**
- **Thomasius's Kenosis:** In "Person and Work of Christ" (1852–61), Thomasius argues for **kenosis**, the setting aside of divine attributes by Christ.
- **Voluntary Abandonment:** Christ voluntarily abandoned divinity's privileges, emphasizing his humanity and suffering.
- **Radical Approach:** Thomasius's view was more radical than early kenoticists, suggesting total reduction to humanity from birth to resurrection.
- **Philippians 2:6–8:** His ideas are based on these verses, justifying a focus on Christ's humanity.
- **Criticism by Dorner:** Isaak August Dorner criticized this approach, arguing it implies change in God, challenging the doctrine of God's immutability.
- **Debate Anticipation:** Dorner's critique foreshadowed the 20th-century debate on the "suffering of God."
- **Adoption in England:** Charles Gore took up this approach, suggesting Christ emptied himself of omniscience during incarnation.
- **Orthodox Opposition:** Traditionalist Darwell Stone contended this contradicted historical teachings and divine immutability.
- **Impact on Theology:** These Christological views influenced the development of the concept of a "suffering God."
- **Continued Debate:** These themes remain a perennial debate in Christian theology, with historical questions arising during the Enlightenment.
