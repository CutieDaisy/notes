## Medieval Theological Landmark in Eastern Europe

**Historical and Differential Facts**

- Byzantine theology derives it name form the city Byzantium, which was the original name of Constantinople, the capital city of the Roman Empire since 330.
- It flourished from the fourth to the fifteenth century, until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.
- Byzantine theological thought was influence by other theological centers in Egypt and Syria, but gained prominence due to political power.
- it emerged as an intellectual force during the time of emperor Justinian (527–56)

- Byzantine theology emphasized its divergence from western theology, on the issue of the filioque clause and the doctrine of salvation
- It did not accept the western idea of purgatory
- Attempts to reunite east and west were complicated by political, historical, and theological factors
- The fall of Constantinople in 1453 did in no way resolve the differences between east and west

**The Emergence of Byzantine Theology**

- Byzantine theologians were not keen on systematic formulations of Christianity
- They saw Christian theology as something "given" by God and tradition
- They focused on defending it against opponents and explaining it to adherents
- John of Damascus, for example, was seen as an important expositor of the eastern Christian theology, rather than a speculative or original thinker

- Byzantine theology follows the principle of Athanasius outlined in his 'On the Incarnation'
- It values the idea of paradosis (tradition), especially the writings of the Greek fathers
- Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus the Confessor, and Dionysius the Areopagite are important sources for Byzantine theology

**The Iconoclastic Controlversy**

- The iconoclastic controversy was a dispute over the use of images in Byzantine Christianity.
- It started when Emperor Leo III ordered the destruction of icons, hoping to attract Jews and Muslims to the faith.
- It involved political and theological issues, such as the role of the emperor and the nature of Christ.
- John of Damascus defends the use of icons based on the materiality of the Christian faith.
- He argues that matter can signify and mediate the spiritual world
- He gives examples of material things that are honored and venerated in the church, such as the gospel book, the altar, the cross, and the sacraments especially the Eucharist
- He challenges those who oppose icons to either reject all material expressions of faith or accept the tradition of the church and the veneration of images

**The Hesychastic Controversy**

- Hesychasm (from Greek h sychia, meaning silence) was a style of meditation that involved physical exercises, such as breathing techniques and body postures, to achieve inner quietness and spiritual vision.
- It was based on the idea that God's presence could be seen with the physical eyes, as in the biblical accounts of Moses and the apostles witnessing the glory of God.
- It was especially popular among some Byzantine monks and mystics, such as Simeon the New Theologian (949–1022) and Gregory Palamas (1296–1359), who defended it against its critics .
- Hesychasm caused a major controversy in the fourteenth century, when some theologians and church leaders opposed it for several reasons:

  - They argued that hesychasm was based on a wrong understanding of the nature of God and his relation to creation. They claimed that God was transcendent and incomprehensible, and could not be seen or experienced by human senses or faculties.
  - They accused hesychasm of being influenced by pagan and heretical teachings, such as Neoplatonism and Gnosticism, which blurred the distinction between God and the world.
  - They criticized hesychasm for being too subjective and individualistic, neglecting the importance of scripture, tradition, reason, and the church community for spiritual guidance.

- Palamas in defence, developed a theological doctrine that tried to explain how hesychasm to be compatible with the Christian faith

- Palamas based his his doctrine on the distinction between the divine energies and the divine essence.
- He maintained that God was incomprehensible and ineffable, and that only his energies could be communicated to his creatures and not his divine essence.

- Palamas's theology was supported and developed by **Nicolas Cabasilis**, a lay theologian who wrote a classic work of Byzantine spirituality called **Life in Christ**.
- Cabasilis's work has been revived and appreciated by modern Orthodox theologians such as **Vladimir Lossky** and **John Meyendorff**, who are known as **neo-Palamites**.

**The fall of Byzantium and the rise of Russian Orthodoxy**

- Byzantine theology reached its peak in the 15th century, but was cut short by the Islamic conquest of Constantinople in 1453
- The Turks waged a jihad against the Christians in the region, ending the Byzantine Empire and its cultural and religious influence
- Russia, which had adopted Orthodoxy from Byzantine missions in the 10th century, became the new center of Orthodox theology and politics
- Greece, which was part of the Ottoman Empire, had to wait until 1829 to regain its independence and revive its Orthodox tradition
