**Pelagianism: A Controversial Doctrine of Human Moral Responsibility and Divine Grace**

- Pelagius was a British monk who lived in Rome and taught the importance of human moral effort in the Christian life.
- He rejected the idea of original sin and argued that humans have free will and can choose to obey or disobey God's law and Christ's example.
- He also minimized the role of divine grace in salvation, claiming that humans can initiate and sustain their own faith and holiness without God's help.
- Augustine, a prominent theologian and bishop of Hippo, opposed Pelagius and his followers, who were known as Pelagians.
- Augustine defended the doctrine of original sin and the necessity of divine grace for human salvation.
- He argued that humans are born with a sinful nature and are unable to do any good or to please God without God's grace.
- He also affirmed that God's grace is a free gift that precedes and enables human faith and obedience, not a reward for human merit or effort.
- The controversy between Pelagius and Augustine became a major theological dispute in the western church, leading to several councils and condemnations of Pelagianism.

- It must however be noted that the development of Pelagianism was as a result of the alarming moral laxity of the Roman church that Pelagius observed, insisting upon the need for constant self-improvement, in the light of the Old Testament law and the example of Christ

**Augustine's Doctrine of the Fall: How Human Nature Became Corrupted by Sin and Needs Redemption**

- Augustine was a fourth-century Christian theologian and philosopher who developed a profound understanding of human sinfulness and divine grace.
- He based his doctrine of the fall on the biblical account of Genesis 3.
- He interpreted this event as a historical and universal catastrophe that affected the whole of creation and human nature, causing it to deviate from its original goodness and harmony with God.
- He argued that human nature is now inherently sinful, meaning that all people are born with a tendency to do evil and to rebel against God's will.
- He concluded that
  - Grace is the free and unearned gift of God that liberates us from the power of sin.
  - Redemption is not something that we can accomplish by ourselves.
  - Salvation is initiated and sustained by God, who acts first and foremost in our lives.

**Pelagius and Augustine: Two Views on Salvation**

- Pelagius taught that humans can save themselves by their own efforts and moral achievements
- Augustine taught that humans are trapped by sin and need God's grace to be saved

- Pelagius minimized the role of grace, seeing it as God's demands or guidance for humans to follow
- Augustine emphasized the role of grace, seeing it as God's free and unmerited gift of salvation

- Pelagius believed in "salvation by merit", meaning that God rewards humans for their good works
- Augustine believed in "salvation by grace", meaning that God saves humans by his mercy and love

**A further Comment on Augustine's Doctrine: Predestination**

- Augustine believed that human beings **cannot save themselves** because of their sinfulness.
- But that even though grace is a **free gift**, He gives to some people, but not to others, according to his **eternal plan**.
- This plan is called **predestination**, which means God has **chosen** who will be saved and who will not before they are born.
- Many people **disagreed** with Augustine's doctrine of predestination, because it seemed to **deny human free will** and God's justice and love.
- Pelagius, however, did not have a doctrine of predestination, because he thought that human beings have the **ability to choose** good or evil and to **earn salvation** by their works.

**The Council of Carthage and the Legacy of Pelagianism**

- The Council of Carthage was a **church council** held in **418 AD** in North Africa, where Augustine was a bishop.
- The council **endorsed Augustine's views** on human nature, grace, and predestination, and **rejected Pelagius's views** as heretical .
- Pelagianism, however, did not disappear completely, but continued to cause **controversy and debate** in various forms for centuries.
- The issues raised by Augustine and Pelagius were **revisited and reformed** during the Middle Ages and the Reformation, when new theological movements emerged .
