- France pursued these questions with particular energy and insight.
- The French theological revival of these years included some of the greatest names in twentieth-century Catholic scholarship. Names like Henri de Lubac, Jean Daniélou, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Yves Congar, Marie-Dominique Chenu, and Louis Bouyer ¹.
