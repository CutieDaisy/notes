## La ressourcement, or La nouvelle théologie

Caption: The French theological revival of 1930-50

- Traditional Catholic theology in Western Europe faced challenges that its traditional approaches were ill-equipped to meet.
- Writers in Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands attempted to develop new approaches that maintained what was good about the tradition while allowing it to engage with the questions of the era.
- France pursued these questions with particular energy and insight.
- The French theological revival of these years included some of the greatest names in twentieth-century Catholic scholarship. Names like Henri de Lubac, Jean Daniélou, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Yves Congar, Marie-Dominique Chenu, and Louis Bouyer ¹.

- **The French missionary movement in the mid-20th century**

  - During 1946 and 1947, there was an extraordinary amount of self-scrutiny and reform within the institutions
  - The movement was motivated by the book France – A Nation of Mission? by Jean Godin, which warned that Catholicism was losing its grip on French society.
  - The book sparked a wave of self-criticism and reform within the Catholic church, especially among the clergy and the youth.
  - The movement aimed to revitalize the faith and the culture of France by engaging with the secular world and the social issues of the time.

- The theological movement of La ressourcement or La nouvelle théologie that emerged in France after World War II.

  - The movement advocated a return to the sources, traditions, and creeds of the early church, as opposed to the rigid and abstract scholasticism that dominated Catholic theology.
  - The movement was inspired by a 1946 article by Jean Daniélou, who criticized the gap between systematic theology and biblical exegesis, and called for a renewal of the church's life and spirituality.
  - The movement influenced many prominent theologians, such as Henri de Lubac, Yves Congar, and Karl Rahner, and paved the way for the reforms of the Second Vatican Council.

- The text describes the main idea of Daniélou's article that launched the movement of La ressourcement in Catholic theology.
- The main points are:

  - Daniélou proposed that the church should overcome the disconnect between theology and the modern world by returning to the original sources of theology, such as the Scriptures, the Fathers, and the Creeds.
  - Daniélou's approach was similar to that of the Christian humanists of the Renaissance, who sought to revive the classical and biblical heritage of Christianity.
  - Daniélou's article inspired many theologians to engage in a critical and creative dialogue with the church's tradition and the contemporary culture.

- **The method and the goal of the theological movement of La ressourcement or La nouvelle théologie in France**.

  - The theologians of this movement did not view this program as a mere restatement of past teachings, but engaged with the tradition in a way to address the modern crisis of faith.
  - The theologians of this movement followed the principle of Charles Péguy, who argued that the church needed to rediscover the ancient and common resources of its faith (such as the Scriptures, the Fathers, and the Creeds).
  - The theologians of this movement adopted the paradoxical motto of Etienne Gilson, who stated that theological progress required going back to the beginning and starting all over again.

- **The practical and spiritual implications of the theological movement of La ressourcement or La nouvelle théologie in France**.

  - The theologians of this movement did not see their work as only academic, but as a way of renewing the religious life and culture of the church and the society.
  - The theologians of this movement stressed the pastoral orientation of theology, and the need for theology to relate to the situation and the needs of ordinary people.
  - The theologians of this movement sought to restore the sense of God's transcendent mystery in theology and worship, by reconnecting theology and spirituality.
