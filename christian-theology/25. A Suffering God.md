## A Suffering God: Jürgen Moltmann

- **Impassible God**: We have seen how the concept of an unchanging, unaffected God gained prominence during the patristic and medieval eras.
-  Martin Luther challenged this view with his "theology of the cross" (1518–19).
- Theology of Glory Sees God's greatness in creation, power, and wisdom.
- Theology of the Cross Identifies God in the suffering and humiliation of Christ on the cross.
- Luther coined the term "a crucified God" to show how God's shares in Christ's suffering.

**Rediscovering the Suffering God: Factors and Implications**

- Jürgen Moltmann's work "The Crucified God" (1972) significantly shaped the discourse on a suffering God.
-  After World War I, three factors contributed to rethinking the idea of an impassable God.

    1.The rise of protest atheism
    - The First World War caused a crisis of faith for many western theologians, who questioned the optimistic views of liberal Protestantism.
    - One reaction was dialectical theology, which emphasized the paradoxical nature of God and human existence.
    - Another reaction was protest atheism, which rejected the idea of a God who allowed evil and suffering in the world.
    - Protest atheism was influenced by Dostoevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov, especially the character of Ivan Karamazov, who could not accept the injustice of innocent suffering.
    - Camus expanded on this theme in his novel The Rebel, which portrayed a metaphysical rebellion against a transcendent God.
    - Moltmann considered protest atheism to be the only serious form of atheism, and argued that the only way to respond to it was to affirm a theology of a suffering God, who shared in the pain of the world.
    2. 2 The rediscovery of Luther:
    - The Weimar edition of Luther’s works, published in 1883, made many of his writings accessible for the first time.
    - This sparked a renewed interest in Luther among German theologians, especially in the 1920s, led by Karl Holl.
    - Luther’s theology of the cross, which emphasized God’s presence in suffering, resonated with the cultural mood of the time.

    3. The growing impact of the “history of dogma” movement :
    - A movement in the late nineteenth century challenged the influence of Greek philosophy on Christian theology, especially the idea of God's impassibility.
    - The First World War and protest atheism made it necessary to affirm a theology of a suffering God, who shared in the pain of the world.
    - The history of dogma movement argued that Christian theology had deviated from its original sources in the patristic era, and that this could be corrected.
    - The goal was to recover the authentic Christian doctrine of the suffering of God in Christ, who revealed God's true nature.

    Three additional considerations may also be noted. 
        * First, the rise of process thought (see pp. 214–15) gave new impetus to speaking of God as “a fellow sufferer who understands” (A. N. Whitehead).
        * Second, fresh studies of the Old Testament – such as Abraham Heschel’s God of the Prophets (1930) and T. E. Fretheim’s Suffering of God (1984) – drew attention to the manner in which the Old Testament often portrayed God as sharing in the pathos of Israel.
        * Third, the notion of “love” itself


Among major contributions to the discussion of the theological implications of a suffering God, two can be singled out as being of
special importance.
    1. The Cross - In The Crucified God (1972), Jürgen Moltmann argued that the cross is both the foundation and the criterion of true Christian theology
    2. Love - In A Theology of the Pain of God (1946), the Japanese writer Kazoh Kitamori (1916–98) argued that true love was rooted in pain. “God is the wounded Lord, having pain in himself.”


The idea of a suffering God might at first sight seem to be heretical in the eyes of Christian orthodoxy. The patristic period identified two unacceptable views relating to the suffering of God: patripassianism and theopaschitism. The former was regarded as a heresy, and the latter as a potentially misleading doctrine.

        Patripassianism arose during the third century and was associated with
    writers such as Noetus, Praxeas, and Sabellius. It centered on the belief that
    the Father suffered as the Son. In other words, the suffering of Christ on the
    cross is to be regarded as the suffering of the Father. According to these
    writers, the only distinction within the Godhead was a succession of modes
    or operations. In other words, Father, Son, and Spirit were just different
    modes of being, or expressions, of the same basic divine entity. This form
    of modalism, often known as Sabellianism

    Theopaschitism arose during the sixth century and was linked with writers
    such as John Maxentius. The basic slogan associated with the movement
    was “one of the Trinity was crucified.” The formula can be interpreted in a
    perfectly orthodox sense (it reappears as Martin Luther’s celebrated formula
    “the crucified God”) and was defended as such by Leontius of Byzantium.
    However, it was regarded as potentially misleading and confusing by more
    cautious writers, including Pope Hormisdas (d. 523), and the formula
    gradually fell into disuse.


The doctrine of a suffering God rehabilitates theopaschitism, and
interprets the relation of the suffering of God and of Christ in such a way
that it avoids the patripassian difficulty. For example, Kitamori
distinguishes the ways in which Father and Son suffer. “God the Father who
hid himself in the death of God the Son is God in pain. Therefore the pain
of God is neither merely the pain of God the Son, nor merely the pain of
God the Father, but the pain of two persons who are essentially one.”
Perhaps the most sophisticated statement of this doctrine is to be found in
Moltmann’s Crucified God


Moltmann argues that the Father and the Son suffer – but they experience
suffering in different manners. The Son suffers the pain and death of
the cross; the Father gives up and suffers the loss of the Son. Although both
Father and Son are involved in the cross, their involvement is not identical
(the patripassian position), but distinct.

THis leads us to consider whether God can be thought of as having died – or, even more radically, as being dead.

## The death of God
- If God can suffer, can God also die? Or is God now dead? 
- A number of significant hymns of the Christian church make reference to the death of God, exulting in the paradox that the
immortal God should die on the cross
- A classical example is the hymn - 'And can it be'

- Three obscure theologians were hailed as the leaders of a new atheistic theology in the 1960s.
    * Paul van Buren (1924–98), 
    * William Hamilton (born 1924), and 
    * Thomas J. J. Altizer (born 1927)
- Their theology used slogans like "God is dead" and "the death of God" to challenge traditional beliefs.
- Their theology also coined some obscure terms that eventually faded away.


- The slogan "the death of God" has two different meanings:
  - **The rejection of God**  especially in the west, as a result of the crisis of faith and the rise of secularism. This view is associated with Nietzsche and the 1960s' "Death of God" movement, which claimed that God had no relevance or meaning in the modern world. (Some Christian theologians tried to adapt to this situation by reinterpreting the gospel in a theological or ethical terms, without reference to a transcendent God.)
  - **The identification of God with Christ** who died on the cross, and thus experienced death and suffering along with the world. This view is advocated by Jüngel and other theologians, who see the theme of "the death of God" as a way of affirming God's solidarity and compassion with the perishable and sinful world.

- In his book called The Crucified God, Jürgen Moltmann uses the phrase "death in God" to speak of how God identifies with the suffering and dying of humanity.
- He uses the cross of Christ as the symbol of God's solidarity with the victims of oppression and injustice.
- He illustrates his point with a story from Elie Wiesel's novel Night, where a witness of a hanging at Auschwitz asks "Where is God?"
- He claims that God is present in the cross, and that God knows what death is like.
