**Pretribulationism: Key Contributions and Effects**

- **Sense of Expectancy:** Through the concept of any-moment imminency, pretribulationism imparts a sense of expectancy to the Christian faith, similar to the early church's outlook.
- **Urgency in Mission:** By emphasizing that the time to do Christ's work is limited and can end any moment, pretribulationism creates a dimension of urgency, promoting an aggressive approach to the church's mission.

- **Revival of Eschatology:** Pretribulationists have kept the discussion of eschatology alive, especially during periods of waning interest, and have anticipated the recent revival of eschatological interest within theology.

- **Eschatological Awareness in Scripture:** They have highlighted the eschatological dimensions in the whole of Scripture, calling attention to passages' eschatological significance that might have been overlooked by others focusing only on primary meanings.



## Defects in Pretribulationism:**
# ONE : 
- **Weak Evidence for Imminence:** The concept of any-moment imminence in pretribulationism lacks strong Scriptural support. Some Scriptures cited by pretribulationists do not clearly back this idea.

- **Questioning the Need for Watchfulness:** The argument for imminence is based on Scriptural injunctions to watch for Christ's coming and warnings about its unknown timing. However, this does not necessarily mean Christ could come at any moment. It could also imply that the exact nature and duration of intervening events are unknown, suggesting a time interval whose extent is not specified.


# TWO :

**Defects in Pretribulationism (continued):**

- **Issues with Any-Moment Imminency:** The "watch" and "you do not know the time" passages were written at a time when an any-moment imminency was not possible. Jesus indicated a delay in His return, as shown in parables like the nobleman, the wise and foolish virgins, and the talents. This implies a period of delay, making any-moment imminency questionable.

- **Parables Indicating Delay:** Parables such as the servants presuppose a delay, establishing the genuineness of the servants. Recognizing this, even proponents like Walvoord suggest a delay that fits posttribulationist views.

- **Events Before Second Coming:** At the time Jesus spoke, certain events needed to occur before His second coming, such as Peter's aging, the gospel being preached to all nations, and possibly the fall of Jerusalem. These events challenge the concept of imminent return.

- **Timing and Language Consistency:** Pretribulationist arguments that imminence is valid now, but not when the words were first spoken, lack consistency. The passage of time does not change the original meaning of the language, raising questions about the validity of any-moment imminence.


# THREE :
**Defects in Pretribulationism (continued):**

- **Ambiguity in Rapture Descriptions:** Pretribulationists interpret passages like 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 as describing the rapture, an event where Christ does not come all the way to earth and remains relatively inconspicuous to unbelievers. However, the vivid description involving a "cry of command," "archangel's call," and "trumpet of God" suggests a more unmistakable event. Posttribulationists argue that this better fits the description of a single, second advent of Christ rather than a separate rapture event.

# FOUR :
**Defects in Pretribulationism (continued):**

- **Translation Issues in 2 Thessalonians 2:3:** The term "αποστασία" can be translated as "departure," but contextually, it is more likely to mean "apostasy" or "departure from the faith," especially given the surrounding references to the man of sin and the accompanying lawlessness and unrighteousness. This interpretation challenges the pretribulationist view that this term supports the idea of a rapture.
