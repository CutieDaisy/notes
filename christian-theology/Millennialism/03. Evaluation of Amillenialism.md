### Caption: Challenges in Interpreting Two Types of Resurrection in Amillennialism

- **Dual Resurrection Types**: The conventional amillennial view distinguishes between spiritual and physical resurrections, though this distinction is debated.
- **Hughes' Alternative Interpretation**: Hughes offers a different interpretation, though noting that the same verb (βξησαν) is used for both resurrections without any clear contextual distinction.
- **Verse 5 Issues**: Verse 5 complicates the interpretation by suggesting that those who participate in the first resurrection do not partake in the second, creating a potential conflict with amillennial doctrine.
- **Grammatical Distinction**: The phrase "the rest (οι λοιποί) of the dead" implies a distinction between two groups, though the second resurrection is not explicitly detailed.
- **Argument from Silence**: The lack of explicit detail where it might be expected raises challenges for interpreting the passage.

- **Ingressive Aorist Debate**: Hughes contends that if "they lived" (εζησαν) is ingressive, then "they reigned" (έβασίλευσαν) must be too, but this leads to a problematic interpretation.
- **A. T. Robertson’s View**: Robertson differentiates between the verbs, suggesting εζησαν could be ingressive while έβασίλευσαν is constative and uses 1 Thessalonians 5:10 as a classic example.
- **Question of Evidence**: Hughes’ argument is critiqued for lacking substantial evidence, particularly against an authority like Robertson.
- **Judging and Reigning**: Hughes’ interpretation unites judging and reigning with the expression "the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness," but fails to provide strong support.


### Caption: Challenges to Hughes' Argument on Spiritual Resurrection

- **Spiritual vs. Physical Resurrection**: Hughes asserts that the term resurrection can imply more than physical resuscitation, but his examples are disputable.
- **Luke 20:35 Interpretation**: For example Hughes' claim that in Luke 20:35 Jesus equate "to obtain that world" to "resurrection from the dead" is very disputable, especially given that the context was to refute the Sadducees' denial of bodily resurrection.
- **Lack of Criteria**: Hughes does not provide clear criteria for distinguishing between physical and spiritual resurrection references.
- **Implications for Doctrine**: Without such criteria, the argument risks undermining the doctrine of future bodily resurrection, an unintended consequence for Hughes since he himself does not want to deny future bodily resurrection


### Caption: Further Critiques of Hughes' Interpretation of Revelation 20

- **"Rest of the Dead" Debate**: Hughes suggests that "the rest of the dead," who do not live until the end of the thousand years, never live again, equating this with the second death.
- **Spiritual Death Argument**: Hughes asserts that those under the power of the second death are never released from it, implying "not living" refers to spiritual death.
- **Need for Clarification**: It is crucial to establish whether "not living" in verse 5 refers to the first or second death.
- **Potential Misinterpretation**: If the first death has no power over the resurrected, then "the rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years were finished" could mean they live after the millennium.
