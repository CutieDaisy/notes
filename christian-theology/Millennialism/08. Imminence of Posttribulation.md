**Supporting Passages for Imminence:**

- **Scriptural Support:** Several passages support the concept of imminence, including Matthew 24:42-25:13, Mark 13:33-37, Luke 21:34-36, Luke 12:36-40, Romans 8:19, 23, 25, 1 Corinthians 1:7, Philippians 3:20, 4:5, 1 Thessalonians 1:9-10, Titus 2:12-13, James 5:7-8, Jude 21, and Revelation 16:15. These passages emphasize the importance of watchfulness, the uncertainty of the timing, and the possibility of Christ's return at any moment, though not necessarily an immediate return.

- **Church's Hope and Timing:** Payne argues that the church's hope lies in deliverance after the tribulation, rather than a pre-tribulation rapture. 

- **Key Passage - Matthew 24:29-31:** Passages like Mark 13:24-27 and Luke 21:25-27, describes events "immediately after the tribulation," including the gathering of the elect by angels. This description aligns more closely with a post-tribulation rapture rather than a pre-tribulation event.

(_In summary, these passages provide a basis for the idea of imminence, emphasizing watchfulness and the uncertain timing of Christ's return. However, interpretations vary, with some arguing for a post-tribulation deliverance based on key scriptural descriptions._)


**Pretribulationist Responses and Critiques:**

- **Elect Jews vs. Church:** Some pretribulationists argue that the passages refer not to the church but to elect Jews converted during the tribulation. Payne finds this indefensible, noting that the audience is the disciples, who represented the church. Jesus used the term "elect" for anyone He chose, and this private discourse was for His disciples after ending His public ministry to Israel.

- **Non-Chronological Argument:** Other pretribulationists suggest that the sequence of predicted events in Matthew 24:32-25:30 is not strictly chronological. They argue that watchfulness for Christ's parousia refers to His coming for the church before the tribulation, while the gathering of the elect after His appearing refers to establishing His kingdom after the tribulation. Payne finds this interpretation artificial and inadequate due to the lack of transition in the discourse.

- **Parousia Confusion:** Payne highlights the use of the word "parousia" in verses 37 and 39, the same word used in the original question (v. 3) and for Christ's later appearance to set up the earthly kingdom. This suggests either Jesus allowed the disciples to confuse the two events, which seems inconsistent with His teachings, or He did not distinguish between them, making the latter a more viable possibility.

(_In summary, the critiques focus on the defensibility of interpretations involving elect Jews, the artificial nature of non-chronological arguments, and the confusion surrounding the term "parousia" in distinguishing between two events._)


**Payne's Synthesis and Prophetic Interpretation:**

- **Harmonious Synthesis:** Payne sought to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the rapture occurring at any time and following the great tribulation by synthesizing strengths from historical, futurist, and preterist interpretations. 

- **Classification of Antecedents:** He divided the antecedents to Christ's coming into two classes: potentially present antecedents and future antecedents. Long-range prophecies, such as the gospel being preached worldwide (Matt. 24:14), divided empire (Rev. 17:12, 14, 16), false security (Matt. 24:38-39), apostasy (II Thess. 2:2-3), lawlessness (II Thess. 2:6-8), and Palestinian Judaism (Zech. 12:10), fall under potentially present antecedents.

- **Great Tribulation:** Payne's significant contribution is the argument that the great tribulation is not entirely a future event. He posits that Daniel's seventieth week (Dan. 9:24-27) and the "abomination of desolation" (Matt. 24:42) have preterist significance, extending only up to A.D. 70. However, references to the Antichrist (Dan. 7:20-25; 11:40-45; II Thess. 2:3-11) indicate that the great tribulation cannot be entirely dismissed as past and must be considered in its future context.

(_In summary, Payne's synthesis attempts to harmonize various interpretative methods and clarify the timing and nature of prophetic antecedents to Christ's coming, acknowledging both historical and future elements in the context of the great tribulation._)


**Payne's Observations on Great Tribulation:**

- **Symbolic Length of Great Tribulation:** Payne noted that Scripture does not specify the exact length of the great tribulation, allowing for various interpretations. The symbolic nature of references means the tribulation may not be very long. While Americans might view it as distant, Christians in politically repressive regions may already perceive themselves as living through it.

- **Political Organizations as Antichrist:** The presence of powerful political entities opposed to Christianity, led by strong leaders, satisfies the qualifications of the Antichrist. At Payne's time, Russia and Nikita Khrushchev were seen as fitting this description.

- **Future Antecedents:** Some future antecedents of Christ's coming, like the trump of God or the wrath of God, are brief and will not significantly delay Christ's appearance. They do not diminish the concept of imminence.

- **Unitary Second Coming:** Payne argued against the pretribulational view of two separate stages of the second coming. He posited a single, unitary second coming that follows the tribulation, which is also imminent. The supposed obstacles to imminency either occurred at the time of the prophecy, are currently happening, or will be brief and not pose a serious delay.

- **Creative Synthesis:** Payne's approach creatively bridges the gap between pretribulationism and posttribulationism. His exegesis is strong, particularly in highlighting pretribulationists' unwarranted inferences and arbitrary distinctions.

(_In summary, Payne's observations address the symbolic length of the tribulation, the identification of political entities as the Antichrist, the brief nature of future antecedents, and the unitary second coming. His synthesis offers a novel and inventive resolution to the debate between pretribulationism and posttribulationism._)

**Weakness in Payne's Argument for Imminency:**

- **Commands and Imminency:** Payne cited commands to watch, wait, work, and be ready, as well as the unknown time of the Lordâ€™s coming, to support imminency. However, he acknowledged that these passages could not have meant imminency to the immediate hearers because certain events, such as the fall of Jerusalem, had to occur first.

- **Flaw in Imminency Argument:** Payne's argument is flawed because if the original audience was not required to hold the doctrine of imminency, then the words of these injunctions contain no inherent meaning that requires it. Elapsed time cannot impart a new meaning to these words. It would only be valid if Jesus had specified to watch after certain events had occurred.

- **Uncertain Timing vs. Imminency:** It's one thing to say we do not know when an event will occur; it's another to say we know of no times when it will not occur. The instructions about watchfulness do not mean Christ may come at any time. If antecedents had to take place before Christ's coming at the time of writing, other definite signs may still need to be fulfilled.

(_In summary, Payne's argument for imminency is weakened by the acknowledgment that certain events needed to occur before the Lord's return, and that the commands to watch and be ready do not inherently support any-moment imminency._)
