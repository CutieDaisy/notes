### Evaluation of Dispensationalism

## Strengths and Benefits:**

- First of all the strength of Dispensationalism lies in its systematic approach. It Integrates the entire Biblical witness into a unified whole, which helps to avoid confusion especially among laypeople and because of it's structured framework, it makes meaning more accessible.
  
- **Progressive Revelation:** Secondly, it takes seriously the idea of progressive revelation, and then develops a theology that highlights and acknowledges the gradual unfolding of truth over time.

- **Thorough Biblicism:** Thirdly, it stresses the importance of knowing the Bible thoroughly, and always asking "What does the Bible say?" on any doctrine. Dispensational schools emphasize the Bible as the supreme authority in matters of faith and practice.


## Problems with Dispensationalism:**

- **Failure in Progressive Revelation:**  First, although dispensationalism attempts to take progressive revelation seriously, it falls short. The focus on Israel's "golden age" and the notion that the Old Testament has not been fully superseded undermines this effort.

- **Distinction Between Israel and the Church:** Secondly, within dispensationalism, maintaining a clear distinction between Israel and the church is challenging. Passages like Romans 9 and Galatians 3 suggest that Paul saw the church as Jew and Gentile alike and the true heir to the promises that were made to the national Israel, indicating more of an integration rather than separation.

- **Distinction Between Kingdom of God and Kingdom of Heaven:** The third issue has to do with the terms "kingdom of God" and "kingdom of heaven". These two terms are difficult to differentiate consistently. For example, passages in Mark and Luke that are parallel to Matthew 13 use "kingdom of God" interchangeably with "kingdom of heaven," suggesting they refer to the same thing, which greatly undermines the dispensationalist view.

- **Inconsistent Interpretation:** Dispensationalism can be inconsistent in its interpretation. It sometimes adopts a literal approach to prophecy and a more allegorical interpretation of historical narrative without warrant. (This leads to a loss of exegetical control.)
