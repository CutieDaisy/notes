## Revelation as Experience

**Introduction**: A model of revelation based on human experience

- God is revealed through the individual's experience of faith, feeling, or morality
- This model is influenced by German liberal Protestantism in the 1800s
- Schleiermacher and Ritschl are the main proponents of this model
- Schleiermacher's approach emphasizes the feeling of absolute dependence on God
- Ritschl's approach focuses on the moral community of the kingdom of God


**A Brief Background of Schleiermacher**

- Schleiermacher was a Moravian Pietist who valued personal devotion and conversion
- He was influenced by Pietism and Romanticism, which stressed on 'experimental religion'
- He moved to Berlin and joined "The Athenaeum", a group of anti-Enlightenment thinkers and writers
- He collaborated with Romantic figures like Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel
- He developed a theology based on Romanticism that highlighted on individual's religious consciousness and feeling


**Schleiermacher's first theological work**:

- Schleiermacher published a writ titled _On Religion:Speeches to its Cultured Despisers_ anonymously in 1799 as a defense of Christianity
- He argued that religion is a feeling of absolute dependence on an infinite reality revealed in finite things
- He claimed that religion is a fundamental and distinct aspect of human life and culture
- He praised religion as the essential context for science and art, without which human culture is incomplete


**Schleiermacher's main theological work**:

- Schleiermacher wrote _The Christian Faith_ as his main theological work
- He argued that Christian faith is based on the experience of redemption, not on concepts or doctrines
- He distinguished between individual and corporate piety, and defined piety as feeling or self-consciousness
- He claimed that the feeling of absolute dependence on God is the essence and origin of Christian theology
- He viewed his theology as a critical analysis of human feelings and their interpretation by the intellect


**Conclusion - Criticisms**:

- Feuerbach challenged the model by claiming that religious experience is nothing but self-experience
- Feuerbach's critique raised questions about the validity and objectivity of experience-based theologies
- Lindbeck and other postliberal thinkers rejected the model by denying the existence of a universal religious experience
- Lindbeck and others argued that religious experience is always mediated and shaped by specific traditions and languages
