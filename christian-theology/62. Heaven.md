### Heaven

### Caption: The Christian Conception of Heaven

- **Eschatological Realization**: Heaven represents the ultimate or eschatological realization of God's presence and power, culminating in the elimination of sin.
- **Consummation of Salvation**: It is viewed as the fulfillment of Christian salvation, where sin's presence, penalty, and power are eradicated, and God's full presence is realized.
- **Communal Nature**: New Testament parables describe heaven communally, likening it to a banquet, a wedding feast, or the new Jerusalem.
- **Trinitarian Understanding**: Individualist views of heaven fall short because of the Trinitarian understanding of God. Hence Eternal life is not an individual's projection but a shared existence in a loving God's community with the redeemed.


### Caption: Paul’s Multifaceted Concept of Heaven

- **Dual Aspects of Heaven**: Paul describes heaven as both a future reality and a spiritual realm existing alongside the material world.
- **Future Home and Present Realm**: Heaven is depicted as the future home for believers and the current dwelling place of Jesus Christ, who will return for final judgment (2 Corinthians 5:1-2, Philippians 3:20, Romans 10:6, 1 Thessalonians 1:10, 4:16).
- **Citizens of Heaven**: Believers are considered "citizens of heaven," experiencing a present spiritual connection while awaiting future fulfillment (Philippians 3:20).
- **Now and Not Yet**: Paul's writings thus reveal a tension between experiencing aspects of heaven now and the full realization in the future, challenging the notion of heaven as purely a future event.


### Caption: Speculation on the Resurrection Body in Early Christianity

- **Focus on Resurrection Body**: Greek-speaking church speculated on the nature of the resurrection body. (shifting from the physical restoration of believers to the resurrection itself)
- **Origen's Role**: Origen (c. 185–254) became a leading thinker on the resurrection, defending it against rival teachings.
- **Two Rival Teachings**: One of the teachings viewed the resurrection as a reconstitution of the human body; the other, influenced by Gnostic thought, rejected any physical resurrection.
- **Spiritual Body Concept**: Origen argued the resurrection body is a purely spiritual entity, suitable for heavenly life, reflecting Platonic ideas of the soul's immortality.
- **Transformation and Identity**: The resurrection involves a spiritual transformation without losing individual identity, though Origen's approach seemed to many to separate body and soul, a concept rooted in Greek philosophy.

- **Criticism of Platonism**: Emperor Justinian critiqued Origen for supposedly teaching the resurrection body was spherical, reflecting Platonic ideals.
- Methodius of Olympus criticized Origen for focusing on an elusive "form" rather than the physical resurrection body.
- **Analogy of the Statue**: Methodius used the metaphor of melting down and recasting a statue to illustrate the physical reality of resurrection.
- **Augustine's Critique**: Augustine who also criticized Origin, interpreted Paul's teachings on the resurrection body as submission to the Spirit, not just a purely spiritual entity.


### Caption: Medieval Speculation on the Resurrection Body

- **Appearance in Heaven**: Medieval theologians debated whether individuals would appear at their death age or a perfected age in the New Jerusalem.
- **Consensus on Age**: By the thirteenth century, a consensus emerged that people would be resurrected at the age of thirty, the age of perfection, regardless of their earthly death age, an idea based on Christ's age at the point of his death
- **Peter Lombard's View**: Peter Lombard suggested that even infants who die will be resurrected in the form they would have had at thirty, free from any defects.
- **Theological Implications**: This idea highlights the belief that the resurrection body is perfected and multiplied by divine means, reflecting biblical miracles like the multiplication of loaves.


### Caption: Continuing Debates on the Resurrection Body and Heavenly Status

- **Physical vs. Spiritual**: Discussions on the resurrection body continue to explore the tension between physical and spiritual aspects.
- **Speculative Debates**: Many regard these debates as speculative and ultimately pointless.
- **Grades in Heaven**: Debates of this nature include whether there are relative grades or ranks among those in heaven, with some arguing for a merit-based status.
- Theodoret of Cyrrhus suggested that status in heaven is determined by achievements during life, based on John 14:2.
- **Medieval Continuation**: The idea of "status by merit" persisted in medieval theology, supported by figures like Ambrose of Milan.
- The Reformation era saw a decline in the merit-based doctrine due to Protestant objections.
- Some Puritan writers still acknowledged degrees of glory in heaven, attributing this to God's grace rather than human merit.
- William Fulke (1539–89) compared the glory of saints to the differing glory of stars, emphasizing God's gifts rather than individual merits : 
    As the stars differ in glory, not according to their merits, but according to
    God’s gifts in their creation; so the bodies of the saints shall differ in
    glory, not according to their merits, but according to God’s free gift in
    the resurrection.
