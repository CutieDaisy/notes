## Process Theology - God acts through persuasion
- Process thought is a philosophical approach based on the works of **Alfred North Whitehead**.
- It rejects the traditional metaphysical view of reality as static and unchanging, and instead views reality as a **process**.
- Reality is composed of **actual entities** or **actual occasions**, which are dynamic, changing, and happening.
- The world is an **organic whole** that is constantly evolving and interacting.



- Whitehead's **entities** or **occasions** have **freedom** and **influence** from their surroundings and **biological evolution**.
- Whitehead allows for **development** within creation, guided by a **permanent order** that he identifies with **God**.
- Whitehead's God is an **entity** that is **imperishable** and **influential**, unlike other entities that are **finite** and **dependent**.


- God is the **order** and **guidance** of the process, but also an **entity** that is **imperishable** and **permanent**.
- Causation is thus not **coercion**, but **influence** and **persuasion**. Entities and God are **dipolar** and **persuasive**.
- God is also **influenced** and **affected** by the world. God is a **fellow-sufferer** who **understands**.



- Process thought **redefines** God's omnipotence as **persuasion** or **influence** within the world-process.
- This explains the **attraction** of this view of God and the world in relation to the **problem of evil**.
- Process thought **contrasts** with the traditional free-will defense of moral evil, which says human beings are free to **disobey** or **ignore** God.
- Process thought says the world's components are also free to **ignore** God's **influence** or **persuasion**. They are not **bound** to respond to God.
- God is thus **absolved** of responsibility for both moral and natural evil.


Here is a summary with bullet points:

- The traditional free-will defense of God explains moral evil, but not natural evil.
- Process thought says God cannot **force** nature, but only **influence** it by **persuasion** and **attraction**.
- Each entity has **freedom** and **creativity**, which God cannot **override**.


- While Process thought **explains** the problem of evil by saying God is **persuasive**, not **controlling**.
- Critics of process thought say this **undermines** the traditional idea of God's **transcendence**.
- Process thought **reinterprets** God's transcendence as **primacy** and **permanency** within the process.


Here is a summary with bullet points:

- Whitehead's ideas have been **developed** by Hartshorne, Cobb, and Ogden.
- Hartshorne **modified** Whitehead's notion of God as a **person**, not an **entity**.
- Hartshorne **responded** to the criticism that process thought **compromises** God's **perfection**.
- Hartshorne **redefined** perfection as a **receptivity** to change that does not **diminish** God's **superiority**.
- Hartshorne **affirmed** that God's **influence** by other entities does not **reduce** God's **status**.


- Process thought **describes** God's action as **influence** within the world-process.
- Nevertheless, it **causes** anxiety to traditional theists concerning the doctrine of God.

Here is a summary with bullet points:

- Process theology has **strengths** in explaining the **origin** and **nature** of suffering in the world.
- These strengths are **appreciated** by comparing them with other **alternatives** in the Christian tradition on suffering.
- This area of theology is called **theodicy**, which will be **discuss** later.
