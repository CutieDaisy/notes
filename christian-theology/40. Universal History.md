Certainly! Here's a summarized version of Wolfhart Pannenberg's theological program with captions and bullet points:

**Pannenberg's Theological Program:**
- **Appeal to Universal History:** Pannenberg's work in the 1960s, especially his 1961 essay "Redemptive Event and History," emphasizes the importance of universal history in Christian theology.
- **Contrast with Other Theologians:**
  - **Bultmann:** Pannenberg's historical approach is distinct from Rudolf Bultmann's ahistorical theology.
  - **Martin Kähler:** It also differs from Martin Kähler's suprahistorical perspective.
- **Revelation as Public Event:** For Pannenberg, revelation is a public event within history, recognized as an act of God, seemingly contrasting with views that emphasize faith as insight or the role of the Holy Spirit.

**Pannenberg's Argument on History and Revelation:**
- **End-Point Perspective:** Understanding history requires viewing it from its end-point, which provides a complete perspective.
- **Marx vs. Pannenberg on History's Goal:**
  - **Marx:** Predicted socialism as the goal of history but
  - **Pannenberg:** Asserts that the key to history's interpretation is provided only in Jesus Christ.

**Proleptic Disclosure of History's End:**
- **Concept:** The end of history is proleptically disclosed in the history of Jesus Christ, meaning it's revealed in advance.
- **Apocalyptic Worldview:** This idea is based on the apocalyptic worldview, which Pannenberg argues is essential for understanding the New Testament's interpretation of Jesus.
- **Interpretative Framework:** Pannenberg uses the apocalyptic elements as a hermeneutical grid to interpret the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, in contrast to Bultmann's demythologization approach.



**Pannenberg on the Resurrection:**
- **Objective Historical Event:** Pannenberg asserts that the resurrection of Jesus is an objective event in universal public history, not just an experiential event for the disciples as Bultmann suggested.
- **Historicity Debate:**
  - **Enlightenment Critique:** Enlightenment writers questioned the resurrection's historicity since it's only reported in the New Testament without contemporary analogs.
  - **Troeltsch's Homogeneity:** Ernst Troeltsch argued that such an event disrupts historical homogeneity, casting doubt on its historicity.

**Pannenberg's Counterarguments:**
- **Critique of Troeltsch:** Pannenberg criticizes Troeltsch's narrow view of history, which he sees as biased and anthropocentric, for dismissing events like the resurrection.
- **Analogies in History:** He acknowledges the usefulness of analogies in historical research but rejects their use as absolute laws to define reality.

**Historical Inquiry and Reality:**
- **Human Viewpoint Limitations:** Pannenberg emphasizes that the human viewpoint is limited and should not be the sole basis for historical inquiry.
- **Role of Analogies:** While not discarding the principle of analogy, Pannenberg insists it's merely a tool and should not dictate a fixed view of reality.

This basically encapsulates Pannenberg's stance on the resurrection as a historical event and his critique of the methodologies that question its historicity.



**Neutral Approach to Resurrection:** (How Pannenberg will like the history to be approached)
- **Historical Investigation:** Pannenberg emphasizes the need for a neutral, unbiased historical investigation of the New Testament, particularly regarding the resurrection of Jesus.
- **Avoiding Presuppositions:** He argues against starting with the presupposition that "dead people do not rise again," as it influences the conclusion of the research.

**Historicity and Interpretation:** (How Pannenberg see the resurrection)
- **Resurrection as History:** Pannenberg defends the historicity of the resurrection, arguing it should be examined without dogmatic biases.
- **Apocalyptic Context:** He interprets the resurrection within an apocalyptic framework, suggesting it proleptically represents the end of history.

**Proleptic Revelation:**
- **Anticipation of General Resurrection:** The resurrection of Jesus is seen as anticipating the general resurrection at the end of time.
- **Revelation of God:** It is linked to the self-revelation of God in Christ, establishing Jesus's identity with God.

**Christological Foundations:**
- **Identity with God:** The resurrection allows Jesus's identity with God to be recognized in his pre-Easter ministry.
- **Divinity and Incarnation:** It serves as the basis for central Christological affirmations, such as the divinity of Christ and the incarnation.

This summary captures Pannenberg's call for objectivity in historical theology and his interpretation of the resurrection as a pivotal event in Christian belief.
