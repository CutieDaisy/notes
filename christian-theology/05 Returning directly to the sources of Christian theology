- Principally, this section briefly elucidates the humanist movement in western Europe,
- It snopsizes the impact of humanist scholarship on medieval theology, which relied heavily on the Vulgate, a Latin translation of the Bible.

The two points of discussions of the synopses are :

- the agenda of the humanist and
- their critique of the Vulgate

## Returning directly to the sources of Christian theology

- The main aim of the movement was to revive the classical culture by advocating for the original sources of Christianity, particularly the ancient writings of Rome and Athens
- They also wanted to return to the foundational resources of Christian theology, especially the New Testament, which they considered to be the most authentic and authoritative source of Christian doctrine.
- The humanists applied textual and philological techniques to study the original languages and sources of the Bible, such as Greek and Hebrew.
- They found out that the Vulgate, which was the standard and authoritative translation of the Bible in Latin, had many errors and inconsistencies with the original texts.
- They argued that some theological doctrines and practices that were based on the Vulgate were also erroneous and in need of reform.
- They challenged the medieval theological tradition that relied on the Vulgate as the sole source of divine revelation, and advocated for a more critical and historical approach to Scripture.

## The critique of the Vulgate translation of Scripture

- The humanists wanted to go back to the original sources of Christianity, especially the Bible, and study it in its original languages, such as Greek and Hebrew as we have said earlier.
- This can be summarized in the Latin slogan - ad fontes - 'back to the sources'
- Erasmus was a leading humanist scholar who produced the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament in 1516, using a few manuscripts that he had access to - only 4 manuscripts for all the new testaments and 1 for the book of revelation.
- Erasmus's text was not perfect in accuracy, as he had to rely on a limited number of manuscripts, some of which were incomplete. As it happened, the manuscript left out five verses which he had to translate from the Latin Vulgate back into Greek.
- Despite its flaws, Erasmus's text was a literary milestone, as it allowed theologians to compare the original Greek text of the New Testament with the Vulgate, which had been used for centuries by the church.

- He gave two examples of translation errors that affected important theological doctrines and practices of the medieval church:

  - The Vulgate translated Matthew 4:17 as "do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand", which suggested a connection between the coming of God's kingdom and the sacrament of penance. He argued that the original Greek text meant "repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand", which implied an inward change of mind and heart, not an outward ritual.
  - The Vulgate translated the angel's greetings to Mary in Luke 1:28 as one who is "full of grace", which implied that Mary had a reservoir of grace that she could share with others. Erasmus argued that the original Greek text meant "favored one", which indicated that Mary was simply one who had received God's favor, not necessarily a source of grace for others.

- This demonstrated the importance of biblical scholarship in relation to theology, and argued for a faithful and critical interpretation of the biblical text.

- The development greatly influenced the Reformation which led to a new interest in biblical studies and exegesis among both Protestants and Catholics - which will be looked at in the next chapter.
