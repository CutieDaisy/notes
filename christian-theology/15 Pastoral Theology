## Pastoral Theology

We explore:
**Caption**: The practicalization of the academic and theoretical aspects of Christianity.

- Christianity is a global faith not just because of it's academic theology or religious studies, but because of its practical and pastoral dimension.
- Latin American liberation theology is seen as a corrective to the western theology's academic bias, and a shift towards social applicability.
- With Pastoral Theology, we see theology not just as a theoretical reflection, but a source of models for transformative action.

**Caption**: The historical connection between theological reflection and pastoral care.

- According to the book, the academic bias of western theology is a recent development, but many early Christian writers linked theology and pastoral care.
- Gregory the Great's _Book of Pastoral Rules_ (written in 590) is a classic example of this link, as it provides practical guidance for pastors based on theological principles.
- Puritanism was a movement that valued both theological integrity and pastoral applicability, and believed that theology should lead to the care and nurture of souls.
- Richard Baxter and Jonathan Edwards were influential Puritan theologians who exemplified this approach in their writings and ministries.
- In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in pastoral theology, which is the branch of theology that deals with the application of theology to pastoral situations.

**Caption**: The development of pastoral theology in the west after the Second World War.

- Pastoral theology is the branch of theology that deals with the practical application of theology to pastoral situations.
- Pastoral theology gained new strength in the west after the Second World War, with the influence of the Swiss theologian Eduard Thurneysen (1888â€“1974) and his work A Theology of Pastoral Care.
- Thurneysen emphasized the role of preaching as a way of communicating God's Word to humans and bringing healing and hope.
- However, the leadership in pastoral theology soon shifted to the United States, where American thinkers such as Edward Farley and Don S. Browning explored how the Christian tradition informed and enriched the pastoral tasks of the church.

**Caption**: The relevance and role of theology in pastoral care.

- Pastoral theology is not an academic subject, but a practical one that relates theology to counseling and therapy.
- Pastoral theology tries to answer the question of what we should do in the face of problems and challenges to faithful action, according to Browning.
- Pastoral theology is critical reflection upon the actions of the church in the light of the gospel and the Christian tradition.
- Pastoral theology provides a way of evaluating situations, and offers resources to deal with them.

## Spirituality

We are going to look at :
**Caption**: The meaning and history of the term "spirituality" in theology.

- Spirituality is a widely accepted term that refers to the devotional practices and inner experiences of believers in a religion.
- Older terms that are still used in the scholarly literature to refer to this aspect of theology are spiritual theology and mystical theology.
- The word mystical use to describe the spiritual dimension of theology dates back to the sixth century, when Dionysius the Areopagite wrote _On Mystical Theology_.

**Caption**: The origin and evolution of the terms "spirituality" and "mysticism" in theology.

- Spirituality and mysticism are both terms that refer to the inner and direct knowledge of the divine or supernatural in a religion.
- Both terms originated in seventeenth-century France, and were used by Madame de Guyon and her salon society as synonyms.
- Since then, both terms have been revived, but with different meanings and associations, causing some confusion and debate among writers and scholars.
- Some writers suggest that spirituality and mysticism are different ways of describing an authentic personal relationship with God, while others suggest that mysticism is a special type of spirituality that emphasizes a direct and unmediated experience of God.
- Many recent writers have avoided the term mysticism, believing that it is unhelpful and confusing, and have preferred to use the term spirituality instead of older terms such as mystical theology, spiritual theology, and mysticism.

**Caption**: The meaning and contrast of spirituality in theology.

- Spirituality is a term that refers to the inner and personal experience and practice of faith in a religion, as opposed to a purely academic and objective approach.
- Spirituality is a term that is hard to define precisely, because it is used in different ways and there is controversy among scholars over how it should be used.
- Spirituality is a term that generally means the experiencing of God and the transformation of lives as outcomes of that experience, and the life of prayer and action that follows from it.
- Spirituality is a term that cannot be separated from the theological beliefs that support and shape that experience and practice.

**The integration of theology and spirituality according to Thomas Merton**

- Thomas Merton was a Trappist monk who had a major influence on modern western spirituality in the late twentieth century.
- Merton argued that there is a close link between theology and spirituality, which must be affirmed and recognized for their mutual good.
- Merton claimed that contemplation is the normal perfection of theology, and that intellectual study and contemplative experience of divine truth are two aspects of the same thing.
- Merton rejected the false division between dogmatic and mystical theology, or theology and spirituality, as if they were mutually exclusive categories for different types of people.
- Merton asserted that theology and spirituality belong together, and that their separation leads to a lack of fervour, life, value, substance, meaning, and orientation in both disciplines.
- Merton thus forged a link between theology and spirituality, and indicated that their integration is essential for the health and vitality of the Christian faith.

**The debate over the interaction between theology and spirituality**

- Spirituality is an important aspect of Christian theology, and it is receiving more attention in teaching and research in Christian seminaries.
- However, the question of how theology and spirituality interact is not settled, and it has been the subject of intense discussion in recent decades.
- The debate over the interaction between theology and spirituality lies beyond this introduction, but it can be studied from any good introduction to the field of Christian spirituality.
