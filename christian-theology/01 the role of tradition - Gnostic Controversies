## The role of tradition: the Gnostic controversies

**Gnosticism: A Threat to Early Christianity**

- Gnosticism was a diverse and complex movement that emerged in the late Roman Empire and had some similarities with Christianity
- It is also very similar to New Age religion

- Even though this portion of the book doesn't explain the concept of Gnosticism, it will be at least good to have an idea of what it's about:

  - Gnosticism was based on the idea that there is a hidden or secret knowledge (gnosis) that can lead to salvation, and that, only a few people have access to this knowledge.
  - It also rejected the material world as evil and corrupt, and emphasized the spiritual realm as the true reality.
  - It borrowed many of its beliefs from Judaism, Christianity, Greek philosophy, and Eastern religions

- Gnostic writers often used New Testament passages to support their unorthodox views, which challenged the orthodox interpretation of Scripture
- Many early Christian writers, especially Irenaeus of Lyons, opposed it and defended the orthodox faith against its errors

**Tradition: A Defense of Early Christianity**

- Because of Gnosticism and its approach to interpreting the new testament it led Christians to come up with a guide line of interpretation of the New Testament
- The word "tradition" means : that which is passed down from generation to generation
- With the treat of Gnosticism, the appeal to tradition became the approach necessary to combat heresies
- Tradition now here means the faith handed over or down by the apostles
- Irenaeus argued that the "rule of faith" was the authentic and apostolic teaching of the church, expressed in the Scriptures
- The church had preserved and proclaimed the same gospel since the time of the apostles, unlike the Gnostics who had invented new and false ideas
- The Gnostics had no historical or scriptural basis for their claims, and were misusing the New Testament passages to support their views

**Tradition: A Source of Authority for Early Christianity**

- Irenaeus stressed the continuity of the teaching and preaching office of the church and its officials, especially the bishops
- Tradition gradually meant a traditional interpretation of Scripture or a traditional presentation of the Christian faith, as reflected in the creeds and doctrinal statements of the church
- The creeds became a public expression of the teaching of the church, which was important for defending the orthodox faith against heresies

**Tradition: A Guide for Early Christianity**

- Tertullian argued that Scripture can be understood clearly if read as a whole, but admitted that some passages can have varying interpretations
- He appealed to the tradition of the church as a way of indicating the correct interpretation of Scripture, as it showed how the church had received and understood the biblical message
- He also stressed the importance of staying faithful to the church's teaching and discipline, which was shared by Athanasius, who opposed Arius's heretical view of Jesus Christ
- They both believed that the right interpretation of Scripture was in harmony with the orthodox faith of the church, which was expressed in the creeds and doctrinal statements

**Concluding Remarks**

- Tradition was seen as a legacy from the apostles, who had taught and preached the gospel to the church
- It was not a secret source of revelation, but a way of ensuring that the church followed the apostolic teaching and did not deviate from it
- Tradition helped the church to interpret Scripture correctly, as it showed how the apostles and their successors had understood and applied the biblical message
- It was expressed in the creeds and doctrinal statements of the church, which affirmed the orthodox faith against heresies
