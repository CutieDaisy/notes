## Trinity - John Macquarrie & Robert Jenson Approach

**John Macquarrie**, a Scottish theologian rooted in the Presbyterian tradition, offers an **existentialist perspective** on the **doctrine of the Trinity**. His exploration provides a fresh lens through which to understand the dynamic nature of God.

1. **The Dynamic Understanding of God**:
   - Macquarrie contends that the doctrine of the Trinity safeguards a **dynamic understanding of God**, contrasting it with a static view.
   - But how can a dynamic God also be stable? Macquarrie grapples with this tension.
   - He suggests that if God had not revealed Himself as **triune**, humanity would have been compelled to conceive of God in a similar way.

2. **The Triune God in Macquarrie's Perspective**:
   - **The Father**: Macquarrie identifies the Father as **"primordial Being."**
     - This refers to the ultimate act or energy of **"letting-be"**—the condition for all existence and the source of all possibilities.
   - **The Son**: Macquarrie conceives the Son as **"expressive Being."**
     - Where the father, the "Primordial Being" flows out through "expressive Being"
     - Macquarrie draws on the idea of the Son as the **Word (logos)**—the agent of the Father in creating the world.
     - For Christians, the finite being of **Jesus** embodies the Father's expression.
   - **The Holy Spirit**: Macquarrie defines the Holy Spirit as **"unitive Being."**
     - The Spirit's role is to **maintain, strengthen, and restore unity** between God and the world.
     - It leads beings back into a richer unity with Being, the very unity that allowed their existence in the first place.


**Let's explore and consider the strengths and potential weaknesses of Macquarrie’s trinity approach.**

1. **Macquarrie's Helpful Linkage**:
   - Macquarrie's approach effectively **connects the Trinity** with the **existential situation of humanity**.
   - By emphasizing the dynamic nature of God, he offers a fresh perspective.
   - However, as we delve deeper, we encounter both its merits and limitations.

2. **Strengths**:
   - **Existential Relevance**: Macquarrie's approach resonates with human experience, bridging theology and lived existence.
   - **Dynamic Understanding**: He safeguards a **dynamic view of God**, avoiding static concepts.
   - **Triune Revelation**: Macquarrie contends that the Trinity reveals **three modes of being within God**.

3. **Weaknesses**:
   - **Artificiality**: Assigning existential functions to the persons of the Trinity may seem **artificial**.
   - **Four Members Dilemma**: If the Trinity had four members, would Macquarrie have devised a **fourth category**? This highlights a limitation.
   - **Modalism Question**: Is Macquarrie's approach a form of **modalism**? Specifically, **functional modalism**?
     - He views the Trinity as revealing three modes of being within God.

In summary, Macquarrie's existential approach enriches our understanding of the Trinity, but it also faces challenges inherent to existential theology¹.

**General Strength and Weaknesses of Existential theology**
Macquarrie’s approach illuminates both the strengths and weaknesses of
the existentialist approach to theology. Broadly speaking, these may be
stated as follows:
1 The strength of the approach is that it gives a powerful additional
dimension to Christian theology, by indicating the ways in which this
theology may be correlated with the structures of human existence.
2 The weakness of the approach is that, although capable of existential
enhancement of existing Christian doctrines, it is less valuable in
establishing those doctrines in the first place.


**Robert Jenson**, an American theologian with deep roots in both **Lutheran** and **Reformed** traditions, offers a fresh and creative restatement of the **traditional doctrine of the Trinity**. His work, particularly **The Triune Identity: God According to the Gospel (1982)**, has sparked renewed interest in this neglected theological matter.

1. **Jenson's Approach**:
   - **Proper Name for God**: Jenson asserts that **"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"** is the **proper name** for the God known through **Jesus Christ**.
   - **Significance of Naming God**: In a polytheistic context in ancient Israel, naming God was essential. Similarly, the New Testament writers needed to **identify the God** at the heart of their faith.
   - **Trinitarian Discourse**: Jenson views **trinitarian discourse** as Christianity's effort to **identify the God who claims us**.
   - **Elaborate Development**: The doctrine of the Trinity involves both a proper name and an **elaborate analysis** of corresponding identifying descriptions.

1. **Naming the Christian God**:
   - The doctrine of the Trinity serves to **identify and name** the Christian God.
   - According to Jenson, this name—**"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"**—is not a human invention but a divine choice revealed through God's self-identification.
   - Jenson emphasizes the **priority of God's self-revelation** over human constructs.

2. **The Gospel's Radical Claim**:
   - The gospel identifies God as the one who **raised Israel's Jesus from the dead**.
   - Theology's task involves **unpacking this sentence** in various ways.
   - **Trinitarian language and thought** emerge from this unpacking.

3. **Defending Distinctiveness**:
   - Early Christianity faced the risk of accidentally confusing distinctively Christian ideas about God with those deriving from the Hellenistic context.
   - The doctrine of the Trinity acted as a **necessary defense mechanism** against such developments.
   - It allowed the church to **discover its creed's distinctiveness** amid competing ideas.

4. **Intellectual Context**:
   - While defending Christian notions of God, the church also needed to provide a **metaphysical analysis** of the gospel's triune identification of God.
   - Paradoxically, the attempt to distinguish Christianity from Hellenism led to the **introduction of Hellenistic categories** into trinitarian discourse.


- The doctrine of the Trinity is understood through **Scripture** and the **church's witness**.
- In the **Hebraic tradition**, God is defined by **historical events**.
- **Old Testament texts** often link God to **divine acts**, like Israel's liberation from Egypt.
- The **New Testament** continues this pattern, especially with the **resurrection of Jesus Christ**.
- God is specifically identified in relation to **Jesus Christ**.
- The question of "Who is God?" is answered as "The God who **raised Christ from the dead**."
- There is a significant **semantic pattern** in the New Testament where 'God' and 'Jesus Christ' are used in ways that define each other.

- Jenson moves away from **metaphysical speculation** to a **personal conception** of God.
- **"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"** is considered a **proper name** for God.
- This naming convention is essential for **religious identification** and **communication**.
- **Proper names** and **identifying descriptions** are necessary for addressing in prayers and praises.
- The concept of the Trinity serves as a **theological tool** for precision.
- It ensures clarity about which **God** is being referred to in discussions.
