**The impact of Copernicus's heliocentric theory on theology and science**

- Copernicus born in 1473 was a Polish astronomer who proposed that the earth orbits the sun, not the other way around, in his book On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies in 1543
- Copernicus's heliocentric theory challenged the prevailing geocentric view, which was based on an interpretation of the Bible and the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy
- Copernicus's theory raised questions about the authority and interpretation of the Bible, which seemed to support the geocentric view by referring to the motion of the sun

**Calvin's role in promoting the natural sciences**

- Calvin was a French theologian and reformer who had a positive attitude towards the scientific exploration of nature
- Calvin developed a method of biblical interpretation that allowed for the possibility of Copernicus's theory of the solar system, and defended the credibility of the Bible against scientific objections
- There are 2 contribution that Calvin made to natural theology with the use of natural science
  - the first contribution was to emphasize the order and harmony of creation, which reflect the attributes of God, and to encourage the study of astronomy and medicine as ways of discovering more about God's works
  - the second contribution was to remove a barrier to the scientific progress, which was the literal interpretation of the Bible, and to propose a method of biblical interpretation that allowed for the possibility of new scientific discoveries
- By doing so, Calvin gave a new interest & motivation in natural theology as a means of knowing about God and his works

**The Royal Society and the influence of Calvin on science**

- The Royal Society was an important institution that promoted scientific research and learning in England since the seventeenth century
- Many of its early members were influenced by Calvin
- Richard Bentley was a prominent member of the Royal Society who gave lectures based on Newton's Principia mathematica, a groundbreaking work on the laws of nature and the motion of the planets
- Bentley argued that the regularity and harmony of the universe, as revealed by Newton, were signs of design and purpose by God, echoing Calvin's idea of the universe as a theater of God's glory

**Calvin's rejection of biblical literalism and its impact on science**

- Calvin's second contribution was to oppose the literal interpretation of the Bible, which was a hindrance to the scientific progress, especially in relation to the Copernican heliocentric theory
- He argued that the Bible used figurative language and accommodated to the common understanding of its readers, not intending to teach scientific facts about the universe
- Calvin's approach to the Bible allowed for the possibility of new scientific discoveries and the harmony between theology and science

**The influence of Calvin on the acceptance of Copernicus's theory**

- Calvin's ideas had a significant impact on the scientific thinking of the seventeenth century.
- Edward Wright was a seventeenth-century English writer who defended Copernicus's theory against the literal interpretation of the Bible, which seemed to support the geocentric view
- Wright used two arguments that were based on Calvin's theology:
  (1) the Bible was not a source of knowledge for Physics
  (2) the Bible used figurative and accommodated language to suit the common understanding of its readers, like nurses to little children
- Wright and other Calvinist thinkers helped to pave the way for the acceptance of Copernicus's theory and the development of the natural sciences
