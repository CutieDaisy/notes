**The re-emergence of the University of Paris in the late eleventh century**

- The University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation that grew out of the cathedral schools of Notre-Dame de Paris around 1150.
- The university was officially recognized by King Philip II (of France) in 1200 and by Pope Innocent III in 1215.

- The university had four faculties: arts, theology, law, and medicine². The arts faculty taught the trivium and the quadrivium, as well as Aristotelian philosophy².

- The university became the most celebrated teaching center of Christendom in the 13th and 14th centuries, attracting many famous professors and students, such as Peter Abelard, Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, and Pope Innocent III.

- Even in the 16th century, it was widely recognized as a **leading center for theological and philosophical study** in Europe, attracting many famous professors and students from different countries and backgrounds.

- Among its students were such prominent individuals such as **Erasmus of Rotterdam** (c.1469–1536) and **John Calvin** (1509–64), who were influential figures in the **Reformation** and **Counter-Reformation** movements.

- The university was also known as the Sorbonne, after the College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon around 1257 for the study of theology.

- The university re-emerged in the late eleventh century because of the restoration of some degree of political stability in France after the turmoil of the Viking invasions and the feudal wars.

  - Feudal Wars were usually confilicts between nobles which mostly does not include killings

- It established a number of theological schools on the Left Bank of the Seine and on the Ile de la Cité, near the newly built cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, which became a symbol of the cultural and religious revival of Paris in the 12th and 13th centuries.

- Other such centers of study were soon established elsewhere in Europe, such as Oxford, Cambridge, Wittenberg, Geneva, Zurich, Leiden, and Edinburgh, where different branches of Protestantism emerged and developed

- Among these centers, the University of Oxford became a significant rival to Paris until the emergence of several Universities in the 14th and 15th centuries in Western Europe especially in Germany
