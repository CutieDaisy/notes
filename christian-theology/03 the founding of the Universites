- The university was officially recognized by King Philip II of France in 1200 and by Pope Innocent III in 1215.

- The university had four faculties: arts, theology, law, and medicine². The arts faculty taught the trivium and the quadrivium, as well as Aristotelian philosophy².

- Among its students were such prominent individuals as **Erasmus of Rotterdam** (c.1469–1536) and **John Calvin** (1509–64), who were influential figures in the **Reformation** and **Counter-Reformation** movements³⁴.

- The university was also known as the Sorbonne, after the College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon around 1257 for the study of theology.
