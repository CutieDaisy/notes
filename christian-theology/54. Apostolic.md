###  Apostolic

**The Usage of the term Apostolic:**
- The term or word "apostolic" is not used in the New Testament to refer to the church.
- "apostolic" unlike the word "catholic," is exclusively Christian and avoids secular confusion.
    * for instance the term catholic could mean - 
        - A member of the Roman Catholic Church or
        - Something that includes a wide variety of things; or something that is all-embracing
    * Eg. You can say someone has "catholic tastes" - meaning the person enjoys a wide varieties of activities
    * But this confusion is not so with "apostolic"

- It fundamentally means "originating with the apostles" or "having a direct link with the apostles."
- Reminds that the church is founded on apostolic witness and testimony.

**Meaning of "Apostle":**
- **Commissioned by Christ:** Tasked with preaching the good news of the kingdom.
- **Witness to the Risen Christ:** Someone who saw the risen Christ or to whom Christ revealed himself.

**Implications of the usage of "Apostolic" in Creeds:**
- Emphasize the historical roots of the gospel.
- Highlight the continuity between the church and Christ through the apostles.
- Stress the ongoing evangelistic and missionary tasks of the church.


### "Apostolicity of the Church"

**Historical Context:**
- The "Apostolicity of the Church" is a topic that was discussed extensively in English theological circles from 1870 to 1914.
- The lectures of H. B. Swete's at Cambridge University (1913â€“14) were pivotal to these discussions.

**Swete's Themes on Apostolicity:**
- According to Swete, there are 3 basic themes which can be deduced from the concept of "apostolicity" of the church

- **Planted by the Apostles:** The 1st is that - the church was established or planted by the apostles.
- **Adhering to Apostolic Teaching:** 2nd - The church follows or is following the teachings of the apostles.
- **Succession of Apostolic Ministry:** 3rd -The church continues or is continuing the apostolic ministry.

**Biblical Basis:**
- Swete highlighted the New Testament, especially the Acts of the Apostles, to support these themes that grounds the apostolicity of the church

- For **Theme no. 1** - He uses the Charge of the Lord to preach the gospel to Judea, Samaria and to the outermost part of the earth and the ensuing acts of the apostles to this charge in the book of acts as his anchor
- For **theme no. 2** - he uses Acts 2:42 - they "continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching ..."
- For **theme no. 3** - Swete uses the example of how believers were chosen and ordained (examples are the 7 chosen to serve (chp6) and Banabas and Saul) in the book of Act to depict the de-volution of authority by the apostles and how that is followed and continued in the church


- It is worth noting that Swete's deductions of topic though much discussed within English theological circles have received wide acceptance far beyond the English national church
