1. **Tritheism**:
   - Tritheism proposes that the Trinity consists of **three separate and independent divine beings**, each fully divine. In this view, the Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit are distinct entities.
   - Some students find this idea **absurd**, as it seems to undermine the fundamental unity of God.
   - However, there are more subtle forms of tritheism that don't necessarily present the three persons as entirely separate gods.

2. **Cappadocian Fathers**:
   - The Cappadocian Fathers were influential theologians in the **4th century**. Three notable figures are:
     - **Basil of Caesarea**
     - **Gregory of Nazianzus**
     - **Gregory of Nyssa**
   - However, some scholars have questioned whether their writings or theology could be interpreted as a subtle form of tritheism but recent research has reevaluated their writings and denied this assertion.


- **Gregory of Nyssa's Treatise**: Gregory of Nyssa wrote a treatise to his colleague Ablabius.
- **Concern About Tritheism**: Ablabius expressed concern that the formula "three persons, one substance" might lead to tritheism.
- **Human Persons Analogy**: Ablabius compared this formula to three human persons sharing a common human nature.
- **Avoiding Tritheism**: The challenge was to avoid tritheism while using this theological formula.

- **Gregory's Assertion**: Gregory emphasizes that the term "Godhead" does not denote a specific nature but rather an operation.
- **Orator Analogy**: He uses the analogy of orators to illustrate this concept. Orators, despite sharing the same occupation, each work individually, arguing in their distinctive ways.
- **Distinctive Identity**: Gregory applies this analogy to the Trinity, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the unique identity of each person within the Godhead based on their distinct operations.
- **Unity in Outcomes**: Despite these distinctions, the Godhead represents a unity in terms of the outcomes of their actions.
- **Human Model Limitations**: The argument acknowledges the limitations of human models in fully capturing the nature of God.


Let's explore the profound statement on the **doctrine of the Trinity** put forth by the **Eleventh Council of Toledo (675)** which perhaps is the clearest statement of the doctrine. This council, though attended by a mere **11 bishops**, has left an indelible mark on theological discussions about the Trinity.

1. **The Eleventh Council of Toledo (675)**:
   - Convened in the Spanish city of Toledo, this council primarily focused on **religious matters** and **ecclesiastical disciplinary reform**.
   - Despite its small size, it is renowned for its **beautiful confession of faith** that succinctly articulates the Trinitarian doctrine.
   - This confession has been held in **high regard** over subsequent centuries and is considered an authentic expression of the Trinitarian faith.
   - The council's formulation is one of the **important formulas of doctrine** related to the Trinity.

2. **The Trinitarian Statement**:
   - The council emphasizes that we should not speak of or believe in a **"threefold" (triplex)** God but rather recognize the **"Trinity."**
   - It clarifies that the **one God is the Trinity**, not merely containing the Trinity.
   - The **relationalities within the Godhead** are crucial:
     - The Father is related to the Son.
     - The Son is related to the Father.
     - The Holy Spirit is related to both.
   - While we acknowledge **three persons**, we do not assert **three substances**; rather, there is **one substance and three persons**:
     - The Father's fatherhood is in relation to the Son.
     - The Son's sonship is in relation to the Father.
     - The Holy Spirit is related to the Father and the Son, as the Spirit of both.
   - When we use the term **"God,"** it refers to **Himself alone**, without reference to another.

In summary, the Eleventh Council of Toledo's Trinitarian confession underscores the unity of the **one God** expressed as the **Trinity**, emphasizing both relationality and shared substance.

After considering various approaches and issues that emerged from dealing with the doctrine of the Trinity, we will now consider the manner in which the Holy Spirit is related to the Son, a subject also known as filioque
