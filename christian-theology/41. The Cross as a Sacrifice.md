## The Cross as a Sacrifice

1. **Sacrificial Imagery**:
   - The New Testament draws on Old Testament imagery and expectations.
   - It presents Christ's death on the cross as a sacrifice.
   - This approach is especially associated with the Letter to the Hebrews.
   - Christ's sacrificial offering accomplishes what the Old Testament sacrifices could only hint at.

2. **Effectiveness of Christ's Sacrifice**:
   - Paul's use of the Greek term "hilasterion" (Romans 3:25) points to a sacrificial interpretation of Christ's death.
   - Christ's sacrifice is trustworthy, permanent, and unfailing.
   - Unlike Old Testament sacrifices, which needed repetition, Christ's sacrifice was offered once and accomplished fully.

3. **Athanasius's Perspective**:
   - Athanasius argues that Christ's sacrifice surpasses those under the Old Covenant.
   - Christ's offering can be relied upon permanently.
   - Athanasius explores this further in his Festal Letters, relating Christ's sacrifice to the Passover lamb.

4. **Augustine's Definition**:
   - Augustine defines a true sacrifice as any action uniting us to God in holy fellowship.
   - Christ's death is the ultimate sacrifice, purging guilt and extinguishing sin.
   - Christ, both victim and priest, offered himself as the pure victim.


1. **Augustine's Perspective**:
   - Augustine, a prominent theologian, emphasized that Christ, as the true Mediator, took both the form of a servant and the form of God.
   - In union with the Father, Christ received the sacrifice in the "form of God."
   - To prevent any misconception that the sacrifice should be offered to a creature, Christ himself became the priest and the oblation.

2. **Hugh of St. Victor**:
   - Hugh of St. Victor, writing in the twelfth century, found the imagery of "sacrifice" helpful.
   - Christ's effectiveness as a sacrifice lies in his ability to represent our fallen sinful nature before God.
   - By taking a victim from our nature, Christ connects redemption to us, uniting us through faith.

3. **Threefold Office of Christ**:
   - A typology dating from the sixteenth century summarizes Christ's work under three offices: prophet, priest, and king.
   - **Prophet**: Declares God's will, scattering the darkness of error.
   - **Priest**: Makes sacrifice for sin, removing guilt and obtaining reconciliation.
   - **King**: Rules with authority, freeing us from the bondage of sin and death.

4. **François Turrettini's Explanation of the 3 fold Office of Christ**:
   - François Turrettini, a seventeenth-century theologian, elaborated on the threefold office of Christ.
   - Each office addresses a specific aspect of humanity's misery due to sin.
   - The prophet enlightens the mind, the priest soothes the heart, and the king sanctifies rebellious inclinations.



1. **Protestant Soteriology**:
   - In the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Protestantism embraced a sacrificial interpretation of Christ's death.
   - John Pearson's *Exposition of the Creed* (1659) emphasized the necessity of Christ's sacrifice for redemption, linking it to His priestly office.
   - The Messiah's mission was to free sinners from eternal death and bring righteousness and eternal life.

2. **Shift in Meaning**:
   - Since the Enlightenment, the term "sacrifice" has subtly shifted in meaning.
   - Originally tied to ritual offerings, it now encompasses heroic or costly actions by individuals, often without transcendent implications.

3. **John Locke's Perspective**:
   - Locke's *Reasonableness of Christianity* (1695) focused on faith in Christ's Messiahship.
   - He downplayed the idea of Christ's sacrifice for sin, emphasizing belief in Jesus as the promised anointed one.

4. **Thomas Chubb's Critique**:
   - Deist writer Thomas Chubb, in *True Gospel of Jesus Christ Vindicated* (1739), argued for reason-based religion.
   - He dismissed the sacrificial interpretation, suggesting that early Christian writers borrowed terminology from Judaism.
   - Chubb believed God's mercy stemmed from innate goodness, not external factors like Christ's sufferings.



1. **Joseph Butler's Dilemma**:
   - Joseph Butler, an English critic of Deism, faced challenges defending the sacrificial nature of Christ's death.
   - Despite attempts to explain its efficacy, Scripture remains silent on the precise manner of ancient atonements.

2. **Horace Bushnell's Vicarious Sacrifice**:
   - Bushnell's *Vicarious Sacrifice* (1866) aligns with Anglo-American theology.
   - Christ's suffering awakens guilt, demonstrating that God suffers due to evil.
   - While exemplarist views emphasize Christ's example, Bushnell insists on objective elements in atonement.

3. **The Unseen Cross**:
   - Bushnell anticipates later theologies of God's suffering.
   - He envisions an unseen cross existing from eternity, preceding the visible one on the hill.

4. **Decline of Sacrificial Imagery**:
   - Since 1945, sacrificial imagery has waned, especially in German theology.
   - Secular contexts, national emergencies, and misuse have tarnished the term.
   - Phrases like "sacrificed for King and country" during World War I contributed to negative associations.

5. **Modern Catholic Sacramental Theology**:
   - Despite secular shifts, the idea remains vital in Catholic theology.
   - The Eucharist continues to be regarded as a sacrificial act, rich with theological imagery.
