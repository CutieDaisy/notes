## Alvin Plantinga


* For Plantinga, the issue of evil in the world is deeply linked to the issue of human free-will, which is a basic christian notion
* His argument for the 'free-will' defense can be summarized as ff:

1. **Free will is morally important**:
   - A world where human beings possess free will is superior to one where they do not.

2. **Denial of human free will**:
   - Forcing humans to do only good would negate their free will.

3. **God's responsibility**:
   - God must create the best possible world.
   - Therefore, God must create a world with free will.

4. **Human choice and evil**:
   - God is not responsible for human evil.
   - God operates under self-imposed constraints and won't compel humans to do good.



1. **God's Omnipotence**:
   - Plantinga emphasizes caution with terms like "omnipotent."
   - Saying God is omnipotent doesn't mean "God can do anything."
   - God operates within self-imposed limitations based on His nature and character.

2. **God's Ability to Create Worlds**:
   - Plantinga argues that God might not be able to create every logically possible world.
   - His essay "God, Evil, and the Metaphysics of Freedom" explores this idea.

3. **Freedom vs. Constraint**:
   - Plantinga asserts that a world with freedom is preferable to one without.
   - The weak point in his argument lies in this assertion, not in discussing God's omnipotence.


## Modern Contributions
- The issue of suffering remains high on the agenda of modern theology,
- It has become a priority due to the impact of the horrors of the Second World War, and the continued struggle of many oppressed people. 
- A number of approaches may be noted, each of which can be set against a different
backdrop

1. **Liberation Theology**:
   - Develops a distinctive approach to suffering.
   - Emphasizes the poor and the oppressed.
   - Views the suffering of the poor as active participation in God's struggle against suffering.
   - Directly confronts suffering in the world.
   - It finds a direct expression in Black Theology especially in the writings of James Cone:
   Which 
      - Expresses the struggle against evil.
      - Interprets the cross and resurrection as a present battle against evil.
      - Believes in God's ultimate victory over suffering and its causes.

   - Martin Luther King echoes similar themes in his writings, such as "Death of Evil upon the Seashore" (1956).


2. **Process Theology and God's Power**:
   - Process theology attributes suffering and evil to a radical limitation on God's power.
   - God retains the ability to persuade but not to coerce.
   - Persuasion respects the rights and freedoms of others.
   - God must persuade every aspect of the process to act optimally.
   - However, there's no guarantee that benevolent persuasion will lead to favorable outcomes.
   - The process is not obligated to obey God.
   - God desires good for creation and acts in its best interests.
   - Coercing everything to follow the divine will is not an option.
   - Radical limitations prevent God from preventing certain events (e.g., wars, famines, holocausts).
   - God is not responsible for evil, nor does God desire or accept it.

   Certainly! Here's a summary of the provided text in bullet points:

3. **"Protest Theodicy"**:
   - Recent thinking on suffering draws from Old Testament themes.
   - Jewish writers like Elie Wiesel highlight passages protesting evil and suffering.
   - These passages challenge the presence of suffering in the world.
   - Christian writers, including John Roth, adopt this approach.
   - It's called "protest theodicy."
   - The protest represents faithful and trusting responses to God amidst uncertainties about God's presence and purposes.
