## Philosophy and Theology

**Christian Theology and Philosophy**

- **Interaction**: Christian theology has interacted with various schools of philosophy over the course of its history, sometimes as allies and sometimes as enemies.
- **Ancilla Theologiae**: This introduces us to the Latin term _ancilla theologiae_, which means "handmaid of theology", to describe the approach of using intellectual resources outside the Christian tradition to develop a theological vision.
- **Examples**: Two of the most important historical examples of this approach are: the dialogues with Platonism and Aristotelianism, which have influenced Christian theology in different ways.

- **Platonism**: Christian theology began to engaged with Platonism, which was the dominant philosophical school in the ancient world, especially during the first 5 centuries, and it borrowed some of its concepts and methods to develop a Christian worldview, while also maintaining its distinctiveness and identity. People like Justin Martyr and Clement of Alexandria used Platonic approach in their theological system developments.

- **Aristotelianism**: Christian theology encountered Aristotelianism in the 13th century, which became the most influential philosophical system rediscovered in the medieval period, and had its resources used to construct a systematic and comprehensive theology, exemplified by Thomas Aquinas's Summa theologiae.

However using another intellectual discipline as the ancilla theologiae, or handmaid of theology, comes with its opportunities and risks. Two of the most important opportunities offered through ancilla theologiae are as follows:

- **Rigorous Exploration**: Using another discipline as the handmaid of theology can help Christian theology to solve its problems and develop its ideas more rigorously, by drawing on the insights and methods of that discipline. For example, Thomas Aquinas used Aristotle's concept of an unmoved mover to support the existence of God.
- **Dialogue with Other Worldviews**: Again, using another discipline as the handmaid of theology can help Christian theology to engage in a dialogue with other worldviews, by showing the similarities and differences between them. For example, Justin Martyr and Paul used Platonism and Stoicism to communicate the Christian message to their audiences.
