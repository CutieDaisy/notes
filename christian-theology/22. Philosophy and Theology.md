## Philosophy and Theology

**Christian Theology and Philosophy**

- **Interaction**: Christian theology has interacted with various schools of philosophy over the course of its history, sometimes as allies and sometimes as enemies.
- **Ancilla Theologiae**: This introduces us to the Latin term _ancilla theologiae_, which means "handmaid of theology", which is used to describe the approach of using intellectual resources outside the Christian tradition to develop a theological vision.
- **Examples**: Two of the most important historical examples of this approach are: the dialogues with Platonism and Aristotelianism, which have influenced Christian theology in different ways.

- **Platonism**: Christian theology began to engaged with Platonism, which was the dominant philosophical school in the ancient world, especially during the first 5 centuries, and it borrowed some of its concepts and methods to develop a Christian worldview, while also maintaining its distinctiveness and identity. People like Justin Martyr and Clement of Alexandria used Platonic approach in their development of theological systems.

- **Aristotelianism**: Christian theology encountered Aristotelianism in the 13th century, which became the most influential philosophical system rediscovered in the medieval period, and had its resources used to construct a systematic and comprehensive theology, exemplified by Thomas Aquinas's Summa theologiae.

However using another intellectual discipline as the ancilla theologiae, or handmaid of theology, comes with its opportunities and risks.

**Opportunites of Ancilla Theologiae**
Two of the most important opportunities offered through ancilla theologiae are as follows:

- **Rigorous Exploration**: Using another discipline as the handmaid of theology can help Christian theology to solve its problems and develop its ideas more rigorously, by drawing on the insights and methods of that discipline. For example, Thomas Aquinas used Aristotle's concept of an unmoved mover to support the existence of God.
- **Dialogue with Other Worldviews**: Again, using another discipline as the handmaid of theology can help Christian theology to engage in a dialogue with other worldviews, by showing the similarities and differences between them. For example, Justin Martyr and Paul used Platonism and Stoicism to communicate the Christian message to their audiences.

**Risks of Ancilla Theologiae**
Two critical risks to be encounted through ancilla theologiae are as follows:

- **Non-Christian Ideas**: Using another discipline as the handmaid of theology can introduce ideas that are not distinctively Christian, and may even become normative for Christian theology. For example, Aristotelian or Cartesian ideas might influence Christian theology in ways that are not compatible with its core beliefs.
- **Negative Implications**: Also, using another discipline as the handmaid of theology can have negative implications for the integrity and identity of Christian theology, and may cause it to be distorted or corrupted. For example, Martin Luther criticized medieval theology for being too dependent on Aristotelian ideas, which he saw as contrary to the gospel.

- **Philosophy**: Despite the risks, Christian theology has continued to use the approach of ancilla theologiae, or handmaid of theology, to engage in dialogue with various philosophical schools, such as Hegelianism (G. W. F. Hegel), Kantianism (Immanuel Kant), and existentialism.
- **Science**:Alister McGrath also sights his use of the same approach to interact with the natural sciences, and to find theological significance in his work, A Scientific Theology.

**Plato: Life and Works**

- **Birth and Family**: Plato was born in 427 bc in Athens, into a wealthy and influential family.
- **Socrates and Athens**: Plato became a disciple of Socrates, the most famous philosopher of his time. He left Athens after Socrates' death in 399 bc and began to write dialogues for which he is remembered.

These dialogues are categorized under three groups:

**Plato's Dialogues: Three Periods**

- **Early Dialogues**: These are mainly devoted to the life and teachings of Socrates, Plato's mentor and friend. They deal with ethical and religious questions, such as piety, justice, and virtue. Some examples are Euthyphro, Crito, and Apology.
- **Middle Dialogues**: These are the most influential and celebrated works of Plato, where he develops his own philosophical vision. It Begun after the founding of the Academy at Athens in 387 bc, which include the famous dialogue The Republic. This reflects Plato’s belief that philosophers should be kings, and kings philosophers.
(This can be seen as reflecting Plato’s hopes for the education of Dionysius the Younger at Syracuse in 367 bc.)

- **Late Dialogues**: These are the most complex and technical works of Plato, where he explores various topics in depth and detail. They deal with scientific and logical questions, such as cosmology, mathematics, and dialectic. The figure of Socrates is less prominent and more of a listener. Some examples are Timaeus, Parmenides, and Theaetetus.

**Plato's theory of Forms**
Perhaps the most important aspect of Plato’s thought is the “theory of Forms.”

- The Forms are the principles of being within the world
- The world of appearances is composed of images of the Forms
- The Form of the good and the logos are central concepts in Plato's thought

- **Platonism's development**: The philosophical tradition of Platonism evolved after the death of Plato.
- **Middle Platonism and Neo-Platonism**: Two major phases of Platonism's later development are Middle Platonism (from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE) and Neo-Platonism (from the 3rd to the 6th century CE).
- **Platonism and Christianity**: Platonism influenced Christian theology, especially the concept of the logos, which means the word, reason, or principle of God.
- **Logos spermatikos**: The term _Logos spermatikos_, meaning "seed-bearing word", was used by some Christian thinkers to explain how the divine wisdom could be present in non-Christian cultures and philosophies, such as Greek thought.
- **Logos and Christ**: Some Christians also saw a connection between the logos and the role of Christ as the mediator between God and the world, following the idea of Middle Platonism that the logos was the intermediary between the transcendent One and the multiplicity of being.

- Many Christian Platonists believe that Christ, as the logos, shows the order of creation to humans.
- Clement of Alexandria, a Christian Platonist, argues that Christ reveals the truth that is otherwise hidden from humans.

**Aristotelianism**

- **Aristotle's background**: Aristotle was a Greek philosopher who lived in the 4th century BCE from 384–322 bc. He develop his considerable talents of observation in response to his father’s interest in the natural world.
- **Aristotle's impact**: He shaped much of western thought, especially after his revival or rediscovery in the 13th century.

- **Aristotle's influence**: Aristotle's philosophy and science shaped medieval Christian and Islamic thought and western culture until the 1600s.
- **Aristotelian legacy**: Aristotelian concepts and ideas still remained in western thinking even after the intellectual revolutions of the centuries that followed.

- **Aristotle's education**: Aristotle joined Plato's Academy at 17.
- **Aristotle's naturalism**: He was interested in observing and explaining the natural world, especially animals.
- **Aristotle's legacy**: His works were unmatched for centuries and his animal studies laid a fundation for Biological science.
- **Aristotle's politics**: Aristotle disagreed with Plato's idealism and advocated for practical wisdom in rulers.

- **Aristotle's school**: He founded his own school, the Lyceum in Athens, in 335bc after leaving the Platonic Academy. He taught a wider variety of subjects than the Academy did.
- **Aristotle's works**: He wrote many works on natural science and logic, but they were not meant for public distribution. They were later titled and organized by Andronicus of Rhodes.

- **Aristotle and Christian theology**: Aristotle's philosophy influenced Christian thinkers like Thomas Aquinas who used Aristotle's principle of motion to argue for God's existence.

- **Aquinas and Aristotle**: Aquinas used Aristotle's philosophy to defend Christianity and appeal to Islamic scholars.
- **Summa contra Gentiles**: Aquinas's book _Summa contra Gentiles_ contains many Aristotelian arguments for the Christian faith.
- **Argument from motion**: Aquinas's first proof for God's existence using motion was based on Aristotle's physics.
