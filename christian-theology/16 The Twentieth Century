- Niebuhr's framework consists of five theological paradigms or frameworks, which he presented in his book Christ and Culture (1951)
- Niebuhr's book was based on lectures he gave at Austin Theological Seminary, Texas, in 1949

**Niebuhr's Five Approaches to Christ and Culture**

- **Christ against Culture**: This view advocates for separation and hostility toward culture, as it is seen as incompatible with the values of the Kingdom of God. Examples of this view are Tertullian, Leo Tolstoy, and Anabaptists.
- **Christ of Culture**: This view tries to harmonize culture and Christianity, regardless of their differences. It is optimistic about human progress and cultural stability. Examples of this view are liberal Protestantism, liberation theology, and feminist theology.
- **Christ above Culture**: This view attempts to correlate the fundamental questions of culture with the answers of Christ. It is based on the idea of natural law and divine grace. Examples of this view are Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and John Wesley.

- **Christ and Culture in Paradox**: This view holds that the Christian belongs to two realms (the spiritual and temporal) and must live in the tension of fulfilling responsibilities to both. Martin Luther is an example of this view, with his doctrine of the two kingdoms.
- **Christ the Transformer of Culture**: This view includes conversionists who attempt to convert the values and goals of secular culture into the service of the kingdom of God. Augustine of Hippo, John Calvin, John Wesley, and Jonathan Edwards are examples of this view.
