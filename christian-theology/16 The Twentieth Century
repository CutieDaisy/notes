## The Twentieth Century: H. Richard Niebuhr (1894â€“1962)

**Niebuhr's Christ and Culture: A Theological Framework for Christianity and Culture**

- Theologians have debated the relationship of Christianity and culture for the past two thousand years
- H. Richard Niebuhr, an American writer, developed a theological framework that has been widely accepted as a useful tool for reflection on this issue
- Niebuhr's framework consists of five theological paradigms or frameworks, which he presented in his book _Christ and Culture_ (1951)
- Niebuhr's book was based on lectures he gave at Austin Theological Seminary, Texas, in 1949

**Niebuhr's Five Approaches to Christ and Culture**

- **Christ against Culture**: This view advocates for separation and hostility toward culture, as it is seen as incompatible with the values of the Kingdom of God. Examples of people who hold to this view are Tertullian, Leo Tolstoy, and Anabaptists.
- **Christ of Culture**: This view tries to harmonize culture and Christianity, regardless of their differences. It is optimistic about human progress and cultural stability. Examples of movements that hold this view are liberal Protestantism, liberation theology, and feminist theology.
- **Christ above Culture**: This view attempts to correlate the fundamental questions of culture with the answers of Christ. It is based on the idea of natural law and divine grace. Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and John Wesley are people who hold to this view.

- **Christ and Culture in Paradox**: This view holds that the Christian belongs to two realms (the spiritual and temporal) and must live in the tension of fulfilling responsibilities to both. Martin Luther is an example of one who subscribes to this view, with his doctrine of the two kingdoms.
- **Christ the Transformer of Culture**: This view includes con-version-ists who attempt to convert the values and goals of secular culture into the service of the kingdom of God. Augustine of Hippo, John Calvin, John Wesley, and Jonathan Edwards are all people who hold this view.
