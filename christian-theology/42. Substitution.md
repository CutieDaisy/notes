## Substitution

1. **Substitutionary Atonement**:

   - Christ is seen as a substitute who goes to the cross in our place.
   - Sinners, who should have been crucified for their sins, find Christ crucified in their stead.
   - God allows Christ to take our guilt upon Himself, so His righteousness becomes ours.
   - This concept gained prominence in the sixteenth century, particularly through the writings of John Calvin and conservative Protestant theologians like J. I. Packer.

2. **Critique during the Enlightenment**:

   - Enlightenment thinkers criticized this approach:
     - Rejecting the notion of original guilt inherited from traditional doctrine.
     - Insisting on rationality and morality in every aspect of Christian doctrine.
     - Questioning the moral implications of "vicarious satisfaction" ‚Äì one person bearing penalties for another.

3. **History of Dogma and Assumptions**:

   - The discipline of the "history of dogma" highlighted criticisms against the Anselmian doctrine of penal substitution.
   - Representatives like G. S. Steinbart and Adolf von Harnack argued that key assumptions had entered Christian theology due to historical accidents.
   - Three assumptions were questioned:
     1. The Augustinian doctrine of original sin.
     2. The concept of satisfaction.
     3. The doctrine of imputing Christ's righteousness.
   - Steinbart considered orthodox Protestant thinking on atonement to be outdated.

4. **Recent Discussions on Guilt**:

   - Guilt, a central aspect of soteriology, more recently has been a subject of discussion where
   - Influential psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud links guilt to childhood experiences.
   - Some twentieth-century writers view guilt as a psychosocial projection, not necessarily tied to God's holiness.
   - These projections are treated as objectively true, even though this view may be an overstatement.

   Certainly! Let's summarize the key points from the provided text:

5. **Vicarious Penitence**:

   - Others raised concerns about the notion of Christ being punished on the cross
   - John McLeod Campbell proposed the idea of "vicarious penitence" of Christ where
   - Christ made a perfect confession of sins on behalf of humanity which is redemptive.
   - In Campbell's proposal, the crucified Christ is seen as empathizing with sinners, and that the
   - The crucifixion is not about the divine imposition of ‚Äúa penal infliction‚Äù upon Christ, but about Christ manifesting and embodying God‚Äôs hatred of sin and love for sinners.
   - Robert C. Moberly also emphasized Christ's perfect penitence as the true atoning sacrifice for sin.
   - Both approaches are substitutionary, in which case Christ does something to offer penitence toward God for sin
   - Other views with similar position can also be found in the writings of the great Scottish theologian Thomas F. Torrance (1913‚Äì2007)

6. **Traditional View and Human Guilt**:
   - Despite alternative views, the traditional cross-centered perspective has significant supporters.
   - The collapse of moral optimism in liberal Protestantism after World War I renewed focus on human guilt and redemption.
   - Credibility crises faced by liberal Protestantism influenced discussions on the need for redemption beyond human circumstances.

1. **The Justification of God**:

   - Written by P. T. Forsyth during World War I.
   - For Forsyth, emphasizing the rediscovering of the "justice of God." was paramount.
   - Less concerned with legal aspects, he focuses on the cross's connection to the moral fabric of the universe.
   - Atonement is inseparable from "the rightness of things."
   - God restores this rightness through the cross, providing moral regeneration humanity couldn't achieve.

2. **The Cross as a Moral Crisis**:
   - The cross transcends theology and forensics; it's a moral crisis beyond earthly war.
   - It represents God dealing with the entire world's soul in holy love, righteous judgment, and redeeming grace.
   - God aims to restore the world's rightness through rightful means, echoing Anselm's doctrine of atonement.

1. **Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics**:

   - A more important note is Karl Barth's lengthy discussion in the _Church Dogmatics_ of Karl Barth, of the theme of "atonement" or "reconciliation" which in the German term "Vers√∂hnung" can mean the same.
   - Barth's section titled "The Judge Judged in Our Place" draws from the Reformed Heidelberg Catechism.
   - Christ is portrayed as the judge who represents humanity before God's judgment and removes condemnation.

2. **God's Judgment and Atonement**:

   - The discussion explores how God's judgment is revealed and enacted.
   - It emphasizes that God Himself takes on this judgment (a central Anselmian theme).
   - The language and imagery of guilt, judgment, and forgiveness permeate the section.
   - The cross reveals God's rightful judgment of sinful humanity.
   - Barth uses the term "S√ºndermensch" (person of sin) to emphasize that sin is integral to human nature.
   - The story of Genesis 3 highlights human delusions of self-sufficiency and autonomy in judgment.

3. **The Cross as the Locus of Judgment and Reconciliation**:

   - For Karl Barth, the cross of Christ is where God's righteous judgment of sinful humanity is revealed.
   - Simultaneously, God takes that judgment upon Himself.
   - The cross represents the intersection of divine justice and mercy.

4. **The Son of God Fulfilling Righteous Judgment**:

   - The Son of God fulfills the righteous judgment on humanity.
   - He takes our place as a human being and undergoes the judgment we deserved.
   - God executes this judgment through His Son.

5. **God's Self-Judgment**:

   - In the cross, God's accusation, condemnation, and destruction take place.
   - The judge (God) allows Himself to be judged.
   - God becomes human to accomplish reconciliation and conversion for us wrongdoers.

6. **Substitutionary Character**:
   - Barth's view is strongly substitutionary.
   - God exposes our sin, takes it upon Himself, and neutralizes its power through the cross.

**Conclusion**
Evangelical theology has maintained a strong interest in legal and penal perspectives on the meaning of Christ‚Äôs death. Notably, since the Second World War, there has been a renewed emphasis on exploring New Testament understandings of the atonement :

James I. Packer expressed this perspective with clarity:
1. **Propitiation and Satisfaction**:
   According to him :
   - Christ's death primarily impacted God Himself.
   - It served as propitiation (or self-propitiation) ‚Äì satisfying God's righteous demands.
   - By offering Himself, Christ turned God's "no" toward us into a "yes."
   - This act revealed God's seeking and saving love, overthrowing the powers of darkness.
