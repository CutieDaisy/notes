### Calvinist Predestination and Assurance

- **Introduction**: Calvinist predestination significantly influenced the attitudes of those who held the belief, particularly regarding assurance of salvation.
- **Role of Works**: According to Calvin, while works are not the basis of salvation, works are evidence of election or evidence of the assurance of election.
- **Demonstration of Salvation**: Good works are to be viewed as a sign of the spirit of adoption.
- **Pastoral Implications**: This belief led to a work ethic where worldly activism helped believers reassure themselves of their election.


### Anxiety and Assurance in Calvinist Spirituality

- **Pervasive Anxiety**: Anxiety over election was a common feature in Calvinist spirituality.
- **Role of Preachers and Writers**: Calvinist preachers and spiritual writers extensively addressed this anxiety in which assurance was often framed through a logical argument:
  - All elected exhibit certain signs.
  - I exhibit those signs.
  - Therefore, I am among the elect.
- **Psychological Pressure**: Hence, believers felt significant pressure to demonstrate their election through good works.
- **Impact on Society**: This pressure contributed to the emergence of capitalism in Calvinist societies, as noted by sociologist Max Weber.



### Misinterpretations of Weber's Thesis

- **Popular Misconception**: The common belief of the Weber thesis that capitalism is a direct result of the Protestant Reformation is historically inaccurate.
- **Weber's Clarification**: Weber himself strongly disagrees that the spirit of capitalism could only have arisen from the Reformation. The fact that capitalistic business organizations existed long before the Reformation is enough evidence of this - argues Weber.
- **Weber's Argument**: A new "spirit of capitalism" emerged in the sixteenth century, needing explanation.
- **Focus on Specific Form**: Weber emphasized explaining a specific form of capitalism rather than capitalism in general.



### Protestantism and the Development of Modern Capitalism

- **Psychological Preconditions**: Protestantism, according to Weber, created the psychological conditions necessary for modern capitalism.
- **Calvinism's Contribution**: Calvinism generated psychological impulses through its belief systems.
- **Notion of Calling**: Weber emphasized the concept of "calling," linked to Calvinist predestination.
- **Assurance of Salvation**: Calvinists, confident in their salvation, could engage in worldly activities without anxiety.
- **Pressure to Prove Election**: This led to the active pursuit of worldly success which history shows was generally successful.


### The Impact of Religious Ideas on Early Modern Europe

- **No Critique Here**: The focus here is not on critiquing the Weber thesis, which has mixed receptions.
- **Weber's Insight**: The fact that Weber recognized the powerful economic and social impact of religious ideas, suggesting that the religious thought of the Reformation could stimulate modern capitalism underscores the need to study theology to fully understand human history.
It also show that abstract concepts like predestination can have significant historical effects.
