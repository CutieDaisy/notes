## Theological Landmarks in Debate: Luther vs. Erasmus and Barth vs. Brunner

- There was a debate between **Martin Luther** and **Erasmus of Rotterdam** in 1524â€“5
  over human will's freedom which became a historical theological landmark.
- The debate had a significant impact and was considered a benchmark for future theological discussions.
- A Modern parallel, in terms of significance, of this debate happened in 1934 in the exchange between
  Karl Barth and Emil Brunner on natural theology.
- Barth and Brunner's origins of disagreement trace back to 1929, highlighting deep-rooted theological contrasts.

**Brunner's Advocacy for Natural Theology**

- **Theological Task**: Brunner calls for a revival of legitimate natural theology.
- He emphasizes humanity's creation in the 'Imago Dei' i.e. image of God, suggesting an analog or relation with the divine.
- Despite human sinfulness, the capacity to **discern God** in nature and history persists.
- Hence, he proposes a "point of contact" within human nature for receiving divine revelation.

**Brunner's Concept of Natural Theology**

- Brunner introduced a concept of Natural Theology in **1927**.
- In his concept, he suggests a natural receptivity in human nature for **divine revelation**.
- He argues that humans have an innate understanding of concepts like **sin** and **repentance**.
- Therefore Revelation comes to builds upon and enhances this inherent awareness, providing a fuller understanding God.

**Barth's Critique of Brunner's Natural Theology**

- **Divine Independence**: Barth challenges Brunner's view, asserting that God's revelation does not require human cooperation.
- **Holy Spirit's Role**: He emphasizes the Holy Spirit's sole sufficiency in establishing a **"point of contact"** for revelation.
- **Inherent Contact**: He rejects the notion of an inherent **"point of contact"** within human nature for divine revelation.
- **Revelation's Source**: And Affirms that any **"point of contact"** is evoked solely by the Word of God, not a permanent human trait.

**Barth's Rejection of Analogia Entis**

- **Concept Rejection**: Barth dismissed the idea of **analogia entis**, which suggests a natural correspondence between God and creation resulting from the creation itself
- **Language Divergence**: He argued that human and divine language do not naturally converge, opposing Brunner's natural theology.
- **Approximations of God**: Barth believed that human descriptions of God are mere approximations and always require correction.
- **Theological Implications**: This stance has significant implications for the use of language about God and the construction of theological concepts.

**Conclusion**

- **Unresolved Issues**: In conclustion, the debate sparked by Barth and Brunner in 1934 remains unsettled, highlighting the complexity of natural theology.
- **Subsidiary Discussions**: There's an ongoing discourse analyzing Barth and Brunner's intentions and interpretations of their 1934 works.
