- **Study on Communion**: In 1943, Ludwig von Hertling published a study titled "Communio: Church and Papacy in Early Christianity," emphasizing the theme of "communion" or koinonia for understanding the nature of the church.
- **Influence on the Council**: This work significantly influenced the Second Vatican Council's reflections and final statements on the church.
- **Term "Fellowship"**: The term "communion" can best be understood as "fellowship" to capture its essence.
- **Biblical Theme**: The concept of communion involves sharing in a common life, whether the life of the Trinity or the life of believers within the church i.e. relationship between the believer and God and relationship among believers.
