Athanasius's arguments: 

1 No creature can redeem another creature.
2 According to Arius, Jesus Christ is a creature.
3 Therefore, according to Arius, Jesus Christ cannot redeem humanity

1. **Communication of Attributes**:
   - Patristic writers grappled with the concept of the "communication of attributes."
   - This notion, often discussed using the Latin phrase *communicatio idiomatum*, explored how the attributes of Jesus (both human and divine) relate to each other.
   - By the end of the fourth century, two propositions gained widespread acceptance:
     - Jesus is fully human.
     - Jesus is fully divine.
   - The argument was that if both statements are true, what is true of Jesus' humanity must also be true of His divinity, and vice versa.

2. **Example: Mary as the Mother of God**:
   - A common argument emerged: "Jesus Christ is God; Mary gave birth to Jesus; therefore, Mary is the Mother of God."
   - This argument tested the orthodoxy of theologians. Refusing to accept Mary as the "Mother of God" was seen as denying Christ's divinity.

3. **Limits of the Principle**:
   - However, there were limits to this principle. For instance:
     - "Jesus suffered on the cross; Jesus is God; therefore, God suffered on the cross."
     - While the first two statements were orthodox, the third was considered unacceptable and unorthodox.
     - Patristic writers agonized over whether God could truly suffer.

4. **Nestorian Controversy**:
   - Nestorius raised concerns about the title *theotokos* ("bearer of God") for Mary.
   - He suggested alternatives like *anthropotokos* ("bearer of humanity") or *Christotokos* ("bearer of the Christ").
   - Nestorius's concerns opened up important theological discussions.

5. **Martin Luther's Radical Application**:
   - Martin Luther applied the "communication of attributes" boldly:
     - "Jesus Christ was crucified; Jesus Christ is God; therefore, God was crucified."
     - Luther's phrase "the crucified God" became famous in modern theology.
     - His "theology of the cross" exemplified a radical application of this concept.
