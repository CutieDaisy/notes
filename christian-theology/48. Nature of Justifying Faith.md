### Nature of Justifying Faith

1. **Luther's Doctrine of Justification by Faith Alone**:

   - Lutherâ€™s doctrine of justification by faith alone came in for severe criticism.

2. **Criticism and Response**:

   - Canon 12 criticized Luther's view of justifying faith.
   - It rejected the idea that faith is merely confidence in God's mercy which remits sin for the sake of Christ.
   - The Council of Trent was alarmed by the belief that faith alone could justify without obedience or spiritual renewal.
   - Trent interpreted "justification" as both the beginning and ongoing growth of the Christian life, not just initial trust in God.

3. **Luther's Actual Position**:

   - Despite Luther's occasionally strong manner of expression, Luther did not hold the position that justification did not require the sinner to be changed and renewed by God
   - He affirmed that the Christian life begins through faith alone, but good works follow (justification)

4. **Trent's Perspective**:

   - The Council of Trent was willing to concede that the Christian life begins through faith.
   - In the eighth chapter of the Decree on Justification, Trent stated that "we are said to be justified by faith" because faith is the foundation and root of all justification.
   - Trent emphasized that faith is essential for pleasing God.

5. **Theological Misunderstanding**:
   - This disagreement between Luther and Trent highlights a classic case of theological misunderstanding.
   - The dispute centers around contested meaning of the theological term "justification."
