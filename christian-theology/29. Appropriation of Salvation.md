- **Basis of Christian Hope**: The Christian hope of salvation is founded on the **death and resurrection of Christ**.
- **Mediation and Appropriation**: Despite this foundation, questions arise about how salvation is **mediated and appropriated** by believers.
- **Two Models**:
    1. **Church-Centric Model**: This model emphasizes the **role of the church** in facilitating salvation. The church acts as a conduit for grace, sacraments, and community.
    2. **Believer-Centric Model**: In contrast, this model highlights the **personal commitment of the believer**. It emphasizes individual faith, repentance, and relationship with God.

Both models contribute to the rich tapestry of Christian understanding, offering different perspectives on the journey toward salvation.


## The institutionalization of salvation: the church

- **Cyprian's Slogan**: In the third century, Cyprian of Carthage coined the slogan: "**Outside the church, there is no salvation.**"
- **Interpretations**: This pithy maxim allowed for various interpretations.
- **Middle Ages Perspective**: During the Middle Ages, the church's institutional authority grew significantly after the collapse of the Roman Empire.
- **Church as Mediator**: According to prevailing views, **salvation was accessible only through church membership**. While Christ made the hope of heaven possible, it was the church that facilitated its availability.
- **Ecclesiastical Monopoly**: The church held an Ecclesiastical Monopoly in dispensing redemption**.



Certainly! Here's a concise summary of how the institution of the church became intertwined with the concept of salvation and its representation in church architecture:

- **Church as Guarantor of Hope**: The idea that the church served as the **guarantor of heavenly hope** was rapidly integrated into church architecture.
- **Romanesque Church Portals**: The grand entrances of Romanesque churches were adorned with intricate sculptures depicting the **glory of heaven**. These sculptures served as a **tactile affirmation** that experiencing this heavenly reality was possible only by entering the church.
- **Inscriptions Over Church Doors**: Inscriptions were often placed over the **west doors** of churches, explicitly stating that **heaven could be attained only through entering the church**.
- **Portal Symbolism**: The church portal was sometimes **associated with Christ**, acting as a gateway. Passersby would encounter words attributed to Christ, emphasizing the connection between the portal and salvation.
- **Example from St.-Marcel-lès-Sauzet**: The **Benedictine priory church of St.-Marcel-lès-Sauzet** in southern France, founded in 985 and developed during the twelfth century, features a portal with Christ's words: "You who are passing through, you who are coming to weep for your sins, pass through me, since I am the gate of life."
- **Tactile Link**: Although these words are attributed to Christ (drawing from the image of Christ as the "gate of the sheepfold" from John 10), a **tactile link** is established with the physical structure of the church itself.
- **Baptismal Font Placement**: The visual reinforcement of this concept extended to the **location of the baptismal font near the church door**, affirming that entrance to heaven is **linked with the sacrament of baptism**¹.

## The privatization of salvation: personal faith

- The Pietist movement, which stressed personal improvement and upright conduct as essential expressions of Christian faith, gained prominence in 17th- and 18th-century Protestant circles.
- Philip Jakob Spener, a theologian and author, played a pivotal role in Pietism. His work **"Pious Wishes" (Pia Desideria)**, published in 1675, outlined a reform program for the German Lutheran Church.
- **Context**: Spener wrote during the aftermath of the **Thirty Years' War (1618–1648)**, a period marked by social upheaval and devastation.
- **Proposals for Revitalization**:
    - Spener lamented the state of the German Lutheran church and proposed ways to revitalize it.
    - **Emphasis on Personal Bible Study**: A central proposal was to emphasize **personal Bible study**.
- **Academic Reception**: Although Spener's proposals were met with **derision by academic theologians**, they gained traction in German church circles.
- **Disillusionment with Orthodoxy**: Pietism reflected **growing disillusionment** with the perceived sterility of orthodox practices.
- **Doctrine and Life**: For Pietists, **reformation of doctrine** was inseparable from **reformation of life**.

- **Pietism Development**:
    - England and Germany witnessed the development of Pietism in various directions.
    - **Zinzendorf's Influence**:
        - Nikolaus Ludwig Graf von Zinzendorf (1700–1760) founded the Pietist community known as the **Herrnhuter** (named after the German village of Herrnhut).
        - Zinzendorf was disillusioned with the **rationalism** and **religious orthodoxy** of his time.
        - He emphasized a **personal relationship between Christ and the believer**, emphasizing a **"religion of the heart."**
    - **Parallel Developments in England**:
        - **John Wesley and Charles Wesley**:
            - **Conversion Experience**: Charles Wesley underwent a similar conversion experience a day before his brother John.
            - **Hymn**: Charles published a hymn, now known as **"Where Shall My Wondering Soul Begin?"**
            - **Key Verse**:
                - "For you the purple current flowed, In pardons from His wounded side,
                Languished for you the eternal God, For you the Prince of glory died:
                Believe, and all your sin’s forgiven; Only believe, and yours is heaven!"
            - **Pietist Worldview**:
                - The core conviction underlying Pietism is that an **individual's free decision to repent and admit Christ into the soul** secures the hope of heaven.
                - **Human Heart as Gateway**: Wesley views the human heart as the ultimate **"gateway to heaven."**


- **Pietist Tradition**:
    - For those within this tradition, the **door to heaven** is not the institutional church or its sacramental system.
    - Instead, it is **personal conversion**—a deliberate decision by individuals to open their lives and **admit Christ as a living presence** within them.
    - The **experience of Christ in the believer's soul** serves as both a **reassurance of faith** in the present and an **anticipation of being with Christ in heaven**.
    
- **Fanny J. Cosby**:
    - The great American Pietist writer **Fanny J. Cosby (1820–1915)** echoed similar themes.
    - In her poem **"The Valley of Silence,"** she described receiving a **"second blessing"** that brought her new assurance of salvation.
    - Her popular revivalist hymn, **"Blessed Assurance,"** captures the essence:
        - "Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
        Oh what a foretaste of glory divine!
        Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
        Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood."

- **Marginalized Church Institution**:
    - Cosby's faith was a deeply personal matter between **her and God**, with the **institution of the church** playing a **marginal role**.
