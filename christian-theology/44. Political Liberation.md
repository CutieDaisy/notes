### Political Liberation
Latin American liberation theology emerged in the 1960s as a synthesis of Christian theology and Marxian socio-economic analyses which places emphasis on salvation as liberation from political and economic oppression.

1. **Salvation as Liberation**:
   - Liberation theology emphasizes salvation as liberation from political and economic oppression.
   - It contextualizes salvation within the Latin American reality of poverty, social injustice, and political struggle.
   - God is seen as siding with the exploited and oppressed, similar to the deliverance of Israel from Pharaoh's captivity.
   - It find's it support on Jesus's preferential option for the poor in his teachings.
   - It focuses on social dimensions of sin, viewing it as oppressive social structures rather than individual wrongdoing.
   - It see social sin as crystallized egoisms in structures that perpetuate injustice - as defined by Oscar Romero.
   - It views Christ's death as revealing structural sin - as highlighted by Leonardo Boff and that he exemplified the suffering experienced by God in the crosses of the oppressed.


2. **Critique of Contextual Interpretation**:
   - Liberation theology has been criticized for interpreting Jesus and salvation primarily in the Latin American context.
   - However, it's important to recognize that all theological frameworks are influenced by their historical and cultural contexts - For instance :
        * the Enlightenment writers approached Jesus within a predetermined framework influenced by middle-class European perspectives and rationalism.
        * Also, Greek patristic writers viewed Christ through a Hellenistic prism, which shaped their Christologies and soteriologies.
   - But while contextual interpretation is valuable, reducing Jesus or salvation solely to political or social liberation oversimplifies their significance.


3. **Christ's Victory Over Oppressive Forces**:
   - The Christus Victor perspective emphasizes Christ's triumph over enslaving forces like satanic oppression, evil spirits, fear of death, and the power of sin.
   - Early patristic writers recognized these as real and hostile presences in everyday life and the proclamation of liberty from these forces became central.
   - An example is the Easter homilies by writers like John Chrysostom which highlighted this liberation through Christ's cross and resurrection.
   - Similar ideas persisted in popular devotional and spiritual writings during the Middle Ages.
   - Martin Luther continued this tradition, emphasizing Satan's objective power and the liberation brought by the gospel.

   Certainly! Let's explore the shift in theological perspective:

4. **Enlightenment Critique**:
   - During the Enlightenment, belief in objective evil spirits or a personal devil faced challenges.
   - Writers influenced by Enlightenment dismissed these beliefs as outdated superstitions incompatible with modernity.
   - In order to maintain the concept of "salvation as victory," theologians needed to adapt.
   - Paul Tillich exemplifies this shift: He reinterpreted salvation as victory over subjective forces that enslave humanity.
   - Patristic writers treated oppressive forces (like evil spirits) as objective.
   - In contrast, Tillich and others viewed them as subjective or existential.
