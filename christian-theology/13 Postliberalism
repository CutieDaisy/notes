## Postliberalism:

**A Theological Movement from Yale**

- Postliberalism is a theological movement that emerged in the 1980s and challenges the liberal worldview
- It originated in the United States, especially at Yale Divinity School, where theologians like Paul Holmer, Hans Frei, and George Lindbeck developed their ideas
- It is not a unified school, but has some common features, such as a narrative approach to theology and a social interpretation of culture and language
- It has become influential in North American and British academic theology, and offers a different perspective on the nature and role of theology in the modern world



**Postliberalism: A Theological Critique of Enlightenment and Liberalism**

- Postliberalism is a theological critique of the Enlightenment and liberalism, which assume a universal rationality and a common religious experience for all humanity
- It draws on the work of philosophers like Alasdair MacIntyre, who argue that all thought and experience is shaped by historical and social contexts
- It proposes a theological approach that returns to religious traditions, and values their internal logic and coherence
- It is antifoundational, communitarian, and historicist, meaning that it rejects a universal basis for knowledge, emphasizes the role of communities over individuals, and recognizes the importance of traditions and their histories in forming experience and thought
