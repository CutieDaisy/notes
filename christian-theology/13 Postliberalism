## Postliberalism:

**A Theological Movement from Yale**

- Postliberalism is a theological movement that emerged in the 1980s and challenges the liberal worldview
- It originated in the United States, especially at Yale Divinity School, where theologians like Paul Holmer, Hans Frei, and George Lindbeck developed their ideas
- It is not a unified school, but has some common features, such as a narrative approach to theology and a social interpretation of culture and language
- It has become influential in North American and British academic theology, and offers a different perspective on the nature and role of theology in the modern world

**Postliberalism: A Theological Critique of Enlightenment and Liberalism**

- Postliberalism is a theological critique of the Enlightenment and liberalism, which assume a universal rationality and a common religious experience for all humanity
- It draws on the work of philosophers like Alasdair MacIntyre, who argue that all thought and experience is shaped by historical and social contexts
- It proposes a theological approach that returns to religious traditions, and values their internal logic and coherence
- It is antifoundational, communitarian, and historicist, meaning that it rejects a universal basis for knowledge, emphasizes the role of communities over individuals, and recognizes the importance of traditions and their histories in forming experience and thought

**A Philosophical Perspective from Alasdair MacIntyre**

- Postliberalism is a theological movement that has complex philosophical roots
- It appreciates the style of Alasdair MacIntyre, a philosopher who emphasizes the relation between narrative, community, and the moral life
- It contrasts with liberalism, which tries to reduce all religions to a common essence and ignores their differences
- It affirms the particularity of the Christian faith, and its distinctive narrative, community, and moral life

**Postliberalism: A Theological Debate with Liberalism**

- Liberal critics accuse postliberalism of falling into a "ghetto ethic" or a form of "fideism" or "tribalism", because of its withdrawal from the common standards of the Enlightenment
- Postliberals defend their position by arguing that liberalism is outdated and unrealistic, and that there is no such thing as a "universal language" or a "common human experience"
- Postliberals use the analogy of Robinson Crusoe's imaginary island, borrowed from the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer, to illustrate the fictionality of the liberal worldview

**Postliberalism: A Theological Vision from George Lindbeck**

- The movement has a major statement in George Lindbeck's book Nature of Doctrine (1984)
- Lindbeck rejects two approaches to doctrine: the cognitive-propositional, which is based on universal truths and is outdated, and the experiential-expressive, which is based on common feelings and is inadequate
- Lindbeck proposes a cultural-linguistic approach, which is based on the language and culture of a specific tradition and is faithful to the particularity of the Christian faith
- Lindbeck's approach reflects the main features of postliberalism, such as antifoundationalism, communitarianism, and historicism

**Postliberalism: A Cultural-Linguistic Approach to Religion**

- The movement adopts a cultural-linguistic approach to religion, which is different from the universalist and individualist assumptions of the Enlightenment and liberalism
- The cultural-linguistic approach denies that there is a universal human experience that is independent of human language and culture
- It affirms that the essence of religion is to live within a specific historical religious tradition, and to internalize its ideas and values
- It recognizes that this tradition is based on a set of ideas that are historically mediated, and that the narrative is a suitable way of conveying them

**Postliberalism: A Theological Insight from Paul Holmer**

- Postliberalism draws on the ideas of Paul Holmer, a theologian who wrote Grammar of Faith (1978)
- Holmer argues that Christianity has a central grammar that regulates its language games, which are not invented or imposed by theology, but are inherent in the biblical paradigms
- Holmer criticizes liberalism for trying to reinterpret or restate biblical concepts, which leads to the distortion of Scripture and the conformity to the spirit of the age
- Holmer affirms that theology is based on the intra-biblical paradigm, which it has to describe and apply faithfully, and that theology cannot regulate Scripture, but has to recognize and articulate the pattern of regulation that exists within the biblical material

**Postliberalism: A Theological Application to Systematic Theology and Christian Ethics**

- Postliberalism is a theological movement that has implications for two areas of Christian theology: systematic theology and Christian ethics
- Systematic theology is seen as a descriptive discipline, that explores the normative foundations of the Christian tradition, based on the scriptural narrative of Jesus Christ
- Truth is related to fidelity to the distinctive doctrinal traditions of the Christian faith, rather than to some universal or public criteria
- This leads to criticism from liberals, who accuse postliberalism of isolating itself from the public arena and the common standards of rationality and validity
- Christian ethics is seen as a practice of identifying and actualizing the moral vision of an historical community, the church
- Morality is related to the internal moral values of a community, rather than to some universal or public ideals or values
- This leads to criticism from liberals, who accuse postliberalism of neglecting the moral diversity and complexity of the modern world and the common standards of justice and human rights



**Radical Orthodoxy: A Theological Movement from Cambridge**

- Radical orthodoxy is a theological movement that arose in the 1990s and sparked some important discussion and debate
- It is a broad approach to theology that is associated with writers such as John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, who were originally based at Cambridge University
- It presents its ideas in works such as John Milbank's Theology and Social Theory: Beyond Secular Reason (1993), and the edited volume Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology (1999)
- It challenges the secular and modern assumptions of theology and society, and proposes a return to the premodern sources and traditions of the Christian faith
- It combines elements of patristic, medieval, and postmodern thought, and engages with various disciplines such as philosophy, politics, art, and culture


**Radical Orthodoxy: A Theological Challenge to Secularism**

- Radical orthodoxy aims to construct its own alternatives to both modernity and postmodernity, which are seen as secular and problematic
- It hopes to articulate a comprehensive Christian perspective that will both supersede and replace secularisms, by drawing on the premodern sources and traditions of the Christian faith
- It finds inspiration in writers such as Augustine of Hippo, who exemplify a rich and integrated Christian vision of theology and society
- It is a complex and sophisticated movement that engages with various disciplines and issues, and that will continue to generate discussion and debate in the near future
