### Transignification and Transfinalization

## Intro: Reevaluating Transubstantiation in the 1960s

- The 1960s saw intense theological debate within Catholicism.
- The Notion of transubstantiation was critically examined by theologians like Edward Schillebeeckx.
- There was an apologetic anxiety which grew during the period over transubstantiation giving rise to two ways of rethinking transubstantiation
- These two ways are :
  - Transignification and
  - Transfinalization


## Transfinalization and Transignification

- **Transfinalization** is the idea that consecration changes the purpose of the bread and wine, shifting from physical to spiritual nourishment.

- while **Transignification** is the notion that consecration changes the meaning of the bread and wine, from food to signifying Christ.

- These ideas avoid the notion of a mysterious change in identity, appealing to a skeptical culture of the day.

- These two ideas were widely adopted by Belgian theologians uncomfortable with notion of "transubstantiation."

- Edward Schillebeeckx advocated for a new approach to retain the theological framework and insights of the Council of Trent without relying on outdated philosophical frameworks.


## Rediscovery of Sacramental Symbolism Post-WWII
- Growing hostility toward ontological or physical interpretations led to a rediscovery of sacraments as symbolic acts.

- Joseph de Baciocchi introduced terms like “transfunctionalism,” “transfinalization,” and “transignification” in the 1950s to explain this shift.

- Schillebeeckx argued that Christ’s presence in the Eucharist is intended for the faithful through the symbolic act of bread and wine, ...

- And that interpretation of the Eucharistic elements as signs is an act of discernment by the church, authorized by Christ.

- Christ's intention - according to Schillebeeckx - was not to change the substance but to ensure the elements signify his continuing presence.

<!-- - Bread can acquire new meaning and significance without changing its physical form, reflecting its relationship to humanity. -->

## Catholic Church's Response to Transubstantiation
- These developments were acceptable to the Catholic Church if they were upheld within the traditional understanding of transubstantiation.
- where the Bread and wine change in goal and meaning as a result of traditional teaching.

- In the encyclical Mysterium fidei 1965, Paul VI affirmed the change in signification and finality due to the new reality of the body and blood of Christ.


## Martin Luther's View on the Eucharist
# Simultaneous Presence: 

- Luther insisted on the simultaneous presence of bread and Christ's body at the Eucharist.

- No Substance is Change. Both substances are present together without any change.

- Transubstantiation seemed absurd to Luther, preferring simple analogies over metaphysical explanations.

- For Luther, the critical point was Christ's real presence, not the theory of how he was present.

- He employed the image of glowing iron to illustrate the presence of Christ.

- He Emphasized the belief in Christ's presence over any doctrine or explanation.


## Zwingli's Memorial View of the Eucharist
- Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli saw the Eucharist as a memorial of Christ's suffering, not a sacrifice.

- Zwingli insisted that "this is my body" (Matthew 26: 26) should be taken metaphorically, not literally.

- Just as a ring reminds a wife of her husband on a long journey, the Eucharist is a token to remember Christ until his return.

- Zwingli adds to the theories of Transignification where the bread and wine change their significance within the Eucharist, from signifying food to symbolizing Christ.

- The change - according to him - is in the worshipers' perception, not in the actual identity of the elements.

- For Zwingli, there is no metaphysical presence of Christ in the Eucharist, just a reminder of his absence and the hope of his return.
