## Reason

**The role of reason in Christian theology**:

- Human reason is the third major resource for Christian theology
- Reason has always been important for Christian theology, but it became more prominent during the Enlightenment
- In this discussion we explore how the use and understanding of reason has varied within the Christian tradition

**The debate over reason and theology in Christian history**

- Reason is expected to have a major role in theology, as humans are rational beings
- Christian theology has debated what that role is, and how to relate reason and revelation
- Patristic attitudes to secular culture and philosophy ranged from acceptance to rejection to appropriation
- Since then, three broad categories of positions can be identified:
  - _Theology is a rational discipline_
  - _Theology is the republication of the insights of reason_
  - _Theology is redundant; reason reigns supreme_

**Theology is a rational discipline**

- This position is based on the assumption that Christian faith is rational and can be supported and explored by reason
- This position is exemplified by Thomas Aquinas, who proposed five rational arguments for the existence of God
- This position does not deny the role of revelation, but sees reason as a way of building upon and extending what is revealed
- This position uses the analogy of a cathedral to illustrate the relationship between reason and revelation, which rests upon the bedrock of human reason, but whose
  superstructure rises beyond the realms accessible to pure reason

- This position views philosophy as the handmaid of theology, a rational discipline that serves the higher truths of faith

**Theology is the republication of the insights of reason**

- A new attitude emerged in the seventeenth century, claiming that Christianity was entirely rational and deducible by reason
- This attitude was exemplified by Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who advocated for a rational Christianity based on innate ideas of God and morality
- This attitude had two consequences: it reduced Christianity to what could be proved by reason, and it gave reason priority over revelation
- This attitude dismissed the need for revelation, as reason was seen as sufficient to know everything about God, the world, and ourselves
- This attitude reflected a strong confidence in human reason and a devaluation of the Christian doctrine of revelation in Jesus Christ and through Scripture

**Theology is redundant; reason reigns supreme**

- This position is the logical outcome of the previous rationalist position, which claimed that Christianity was entirely rational and deducible by reason
- This position argues that Christianity actually contains many beliefs that are irrational and incompatible with reason
- This position asserts that reason has the authority to judge and reject religion, as it is superior to revelation
- This position is known as Enlightenment rationalism, and it is a significant challenge to Christian theology
- This position is influenced by Deism, an English movement that advocated for a natural religion based on reason and rejected supernatural revelation
