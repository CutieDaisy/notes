### The Multiple Functions of the Sacraments

### Understanding the Role of Sacraments in Christian Theology

- **Historical Development**: Various interpretations of the sacraments' roles have emerged throughout Christian theological history.
- **Four Key Views**: In this summary we shall look at four significant perspectives on the sacraments' functions.
- **Compatibility**: These views we are going to look at are not mutually exclusive; for instance, the idea that sacraments convey grace aligns with the belief that they reassure believers of God's promises.
- **Debate Focus**: The main debate revolves around which functions are essential for a proper understanding of the sacraments.
<!-- - **Theological Approaches**: Most theologians incorporate multiple themes in their overall approach to sacraments, though they may emphasize different aspects. -->


## Sacraments convey Grace ----------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Medieval Emphasis**: Medieval writers insisted that sacraments convey the grace they signify.
- **Early Traces**: For instance, Ignatius of Antioch describe the Eucharist as “the medicine of immortality.”
- **Ambrose of Milan**: In the fourth century, Ambrose argued that the Holy Spirit, through baptism, effects regeneration.
- **Augustine's Distinction**: Augustine distinguished between the sacrament as a sign and it as a "force" (virtus).
- For Augustine and his medieval successors, a major function of the sacraments is the efficacious bestowal of grace.

- **Duns Scotus' View**: Medieval writers sympathetic to Duns Scotus argued against the idea that sacraments strictly cause grace.
- Peter of Aquila, (clarifying Peter Lombard statement on the subject) emphasized that sacraments do not cause grace by themselves; rather, it is God who effects grace.
- **Causa Sine Qua Non**: Sacraments are to be seen as indispensable preconditions (causa sine qua non) rather than direct causes of grace.
- Catholic Theology also insists that God is the agent, remote efficient cause, and the final cause of grace in any legitimate theory of sacramental causality.

# Rejection by Reformers
- Protestant reformers like Peter Martyr Vermigli rejected the view that sacraments, particularly baptism, are efficacious in themselves as taught by Augustine on the efficacious nature of sacraments.
 <!-- Augustine believed that baptism itself regenerates and adopts individuals into the family of Christ, a view not shared by the reformers. -->

 # Council of Trent on Sacramental Efficacy
- But the Council of Trent reaffirmed the efficacious nature of sacraments criticizing Protestant's tendency to view sacraments as mere signs rather than causes of grace.
- Trent preferred the term "conferring" grace over "causing" grace, aligning with the Scotist position.

## Sacrament Strengthen faith -----------------------------------------------------------------

- **Reformation Significance**: During the sixteenth-century Reformation, sacraments gained special importance due to the emphasis on trust (fiducia) as a key component of justifying faith.
- **Response to Human Weakness**: Reformers viewed sacraments as God's response to human frailty, providing visible and tangible signs of divine promises.


Let's look at 4 groups of people who saw the sacraments as catalyst to strengthen faith 
# 1st is Melanchthon
<!-- - **Philip Melanchthon's View**: In his 1521 "Propositions on the Mass," Melanchthon highlighted sacraments as a gracious accommodation to human weakness.
- **Reassurance and Reminder**: Melanchthon emphasized that signs (i.e. sacraments) serve to remind and reassure believers of the word of faith. -->

- There are 3 areas Melanchton's view on sacraments in relation to faith can be expressed, They are :
- **Purpose of Sacrament**: According to Melanchthon, sacrament or signs are added to God's promises to mitigate human distrust and strengthen faith.
- **The Nature of Sacrament**: Sacraments do not justify - they have a Non-Justifying nature; they are testimonies and seals of God's will, providing assurance to doubting consciences.
- **Effect of Sacraments**: The use of signs is seen as highly beneficial for consoling and strengthening the conscience.
<!-- - **Comparison to Symbols**: Sacramental signs are likened to symbols or military passwords, marking those to whom divine promises pertain. -->

# 2nd is Luther
- **Luther's Definition**: Luther defined sacraments as “promises with signs attached to them” or “divinely instituted signs and the promise of forgiveness of sins.”
- **Eucharist as a Pledge**: He used the term “pledge” to highlight the security-giving nature of the Eucharist
# 3rd is the Catholics
- **Twentieth-Century Catholic Revival**: A similar view was espoused during the revival in sacramental theology within Catholicism in the twentieth century.

- **Importance of Sacraments**: The Second Vatican Council emphasized sacraments' role in the growth of faith, both in personal commitment and understanding.
<!-- - **Faith Distinction**: Christian theology distinguishes between:
  - **Fides qua creditur**: The act of trust and assent in Christian belief.
  - **Fides quae creditur**: The specific content of Christian faith, such as creeds and doctrines. -->
- **Nourishing Faith**: Sacraments sustain and nourish all (both) aspects of faith.
- **Instructional Role**: As signs, sacraments instruct, nourish, strengthen, and express faith.
- **Grace and Celebration**: Sacraments confer grace and their celebration disposes the faithful to receive grace, worship God, and practice charity.

## Sacraments enhance unity and commitment in the Church -------------------------------------------------------

- The unity of the church was a significant issue during the patristic period, especially due to divisions from the Decian and Diocletian persecutions.
- Cyprian of Carthage Emphasized church unity and urged members to work towards greater harmony and commitment.
- Augustine expanded on this, highlighting the role of sacraments in fostering societal cohesion.
- Huldrych Zwingli writings during the Reformation period strongly emphasized this point.

# Luther's view
- For Luther, there are about 4 are we can deduced from his view on the topic :
- **1st - Psychological Assurance**: In his 1519 treatise, Luther highlighted the psychological comfort sacraments provide to believers.
- **2nd - Fellowship and Union**: Receiving the sacrament in bread and wine is seen as a sure sign of fellowship and union with Christ and all the saints.
- **3rd Citizenship Analogy**: Luther compared sacraments to tokens or documents that assure citizens of their membership in a community.
- **4th - Unity with Christ**: The sacrament signifies that believers are united with Christ and share in His suffering and life.
- **5th - Community Belonging**: the sacraments are tokens of belonging to the Christian
community 

# Zwingli's view
- **Purpose of Sacraments**: Zwingli viewed sacraments as demonstrations of an individual's belonging to the faith community.
- **Baptism as Declaration**: Baptism publicly declares a person's membership in the household of God.
- **Old Testament Parallel**: Zwingli compared baptism to Old Testament circumcision, a sign of belonging to the covenant community.
- **Inclusivity of Baptism**: and more superior, Baptism is gentler and more inclusive than circumcision, involving no pain and including both male and female.
- **Eucharist as Loyalty**: Attendance at the Eucharist is a public declaration of loyalty to the church.
- **Memorialist Approach**: The Eucharist serves as a memorial of the church's founding event and a public demonstration of allegiance to the church and its members.

## Sacrament reassures us of God's promises towards us -----------------------------------------------------

- **Emphasis on Faith**: The Reformers recognized the need for reassurance of God's love and commitment due to human frailty.
- **Luther's View**: Luther saw Christ's death as a testament, akin to a "last will and testament," signifying the trustworthiness and cost of God's grace.
- **Testament Concept**: In his 1520 work, Luther explained that a testament involves the death of the testator, a promise of inheritance, and the identification of heirs.
- **Christ's Testament**: Christ's words during the Last Supper ("This is my body... This is my blood...") are seen as His testament, promising or assuring forgiveness of sins and designating believers as heirs.

- **Testament Concept**: Luther emphasized that a testament involves promises that become effective after the death of the testator.
- **There three Key Points** the Eucharist liturgy demonstrates:
  1. Affirms the promises of grace and forgiveness.
  2. Identifies the recipients of these promises.
  3. Declares the death of the one who made these promises.
