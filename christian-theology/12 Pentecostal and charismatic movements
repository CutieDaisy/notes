## Penticostal and Charismatic Movement

**The rise of charismatic and Pentecostal Christianity in the twentieth century**

It is said that, one of the most significant developments in Christianity in the twentieth
century was the rise of charismatic and Pentecostal categories,

- Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians believe that they can experience the power of the Holy Spirit as described in the New Testament, especially in the Acts of the Apostles.
- The term "charismatic" comes from the Greek word charismata, which means "gifts" or "spiritual gifts" that are available to modern Christians.
- The term "Pentecostal" refers to the events that happened on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2: 1–12), when the Holy Spirit came upon the first disciples and enabled them to speak in different languages. Pentecostal Christians consider this as a model for the normal Christian life.

**The three waves of charismatic movements in the twentieth century**

- The modern rediscovery of spiritual gifts is linked with the movement
  known as Pentecostalism.
- According to Peter C. Wagner (in his book The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit (1988)), there are 3 waves of this rediscovery :
  - The first wave was Pentecostalism, which emerged in the early 1900s and focused on speaking in tongues as a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence.
  - The second was the charismatic renewal, which spread in the 1960s and 1970s among the mainline churches, including Catholicism, and embraced spiritual healing and other charismatic practices.
  - The third wave was the signs and wonders movement, which was influenced by John Wimber (1934–97) and emphasized the demonstration of God's power through miracles and healings.

**The origins of Pentecostalism in the early twentieth century**

- Even though the charismatic movement can be argued to have long historical roots, its twentieth-century development is generally traced to Charles Fox Parham.
- The charismatic movement was largely influenced by Charles Fox Parham (1873–1929), who taught that speaking in tongues and the baptism of the Holy Spirit were signs of true Christianity.
- Moreover, the ideas of Charles were further developed by Joseph William Seymour (1870–1922), a black pastor, who led the Azusa Street Mission revival in Los Angeles from 1906 to 1908
- Most of the major Pentecostal denominations, such as the Assemblies of God, trace their roots back to the Azusa Street Revival and its participants.

**The debates and challenges of Pentecostalism in the modern church**
- The new awareness and experience of the Holy Spirit in the modern church has raised a couple of debates over :
  - the nature of baptism of the Spirit, and
  - which of the various “spiritual gifts” (charismata) are of greatest importance in relation both to:
    - personal faith and spirituality, and to
    - the up-building of the church as a whole.
- Because of this, Pentecostalism has, generally, been suspicious of traditional theology, seeing it as placing too much emphasis on rational reflection on the Christian faith, thereby neglecting its experiential aspects.
