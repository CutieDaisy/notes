## Doctrine of Creation Ex-nihilo


- Christianity grew and spread in the eastern Mediterranean region in the first two centuries CE, where Greek philosophies were influential.
- The Greeks believed that God did not create the world, but rather arranged it from pre-existing matter.
- God was seen as an architect or a craftsman, who gave shape and structure to the chaotic matter.
- Plato, a prominent Greek philosopher, expressed this idea in his dialogue Timaeus, where he described the world as a product of pre-existent matter and divine reason..


**Plato's Idea extended**
- Plato's idea of pre-existent matter as the basis of the world was adopted by Gnostic writers and some early Christian theologians like Theophilus of Antioch and Justin Martyr
- Creation was not from nothing, but from shaping the pre-existent matter, like building something from existing materials.
- Evil and defects in the world were due to the imperfections of the pre-existent matter, not God's fault.


- The conflict with Gnosticism challenged the idea of creation from pre-existent matter.
- Some Christian writers of the second and third centuries asserted that God created everything from nothing, based on a deeper understanding of the Old Testament.
- Irenaeus defended the Christian view of creation as good, in contrast to the Gnostic view of creation as evil.


- Tertullian argued that God freely and goodly created the world, not because of any need or constraint from matter.
- The world's existence and order depend on God, unlike Aristotle's view that the world was eternal and necessary.
- Augustine supported and developed the idea of creation from nothing in his works.


- Yet Some Christian theologians, like Origen, still favored the idea of creation from pre-existent matter in the early Christian tradition.
- By the fourth century, most Christian theologians dismissed the Platonist view, even Origen's version, and affirmed God as the creator of everything.



Implications of The doctrine of God as creator.

- God and creation are different: God is necessary and eternal, creation is contingent and temporal. Christian theology rejects any confusion or identification of God and creation, as Paul warns in Romans 1: 25.
- God has authority over creation: Humans are part of creation, but have a special role as stewards, not owners, of God's world. This implies a moral duty to care for the environment and respect God's will.
- Creation is good: God declared everything he made to be good in Genesis 1. Creation is not evil, as some Gnostics or dualists claimed, but is affected by sin. However, creation can still be restored by God's grace.
- Creation is not perfect: Sin has corrupted the world and deviated it from God's original plan. The world we see is not the world God intended. Human sin, evil, and death are signs of this distortion. Christian redemption involves the renewal of creation to its original glory. God is not the cause of evil, but the source of goodness.
- Humans are in God's image: Genesis implies that humans are made in God's likeness, which is a key Christian doctrine of human nature. This means that humans have a special relationship with God and a purpose in his creation. Augustine expressed this idea by saying that humans are restless until they find rest in God. The doctrine of creation helps us understand human experience, nature, and destiny.
