**Introduction**
The Reformation era was a time of great theological creativity in Christianity according to the text. It mentions three theologians who were very influential: Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli. However, it says that Luther and Calvin were more important than Zwingli, because they had more original ideas and more impact on theology.

**Martin Luther (1483–1546)**

- Luther studied arts and theology at the University of Erfurt and became a professor of biblical studies at the University of Wittenberg.
- Luther lectured on several books of the Bible, such as the Psalms, Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews, between 1513 and 1518.
- Luther developed his doctrine of justification by faith alone, which challenged the prevailing theological views of his time and led him to propose reforms for the church.

- > There were a couple of events that made Luther a public figure and a theological reformer in 1517-1520.
- Some of them are:

  - Luther published his “Ninety-five Theses” on indulgences, which criticized the church for selling pardons for sins.
  - Luther debated with a scholastic theologian at the Leipzig Disputation, where he rejected the authority of the pope and the church councils.
  - Luther wrote three treatises that called for the reform of the church based on the New Testament. He used clear and lively German to appeal to the common people.

- Some further works of Martin Luther:

  - Luther wrote The Babylonian Captivity of the Christian Church, where he argued that the gospel was enslaved by the church's system of priests and sacraments.
  - He also wrote The Liberty of a Christian, where he explained how the doctrine of justification by faith freed Christians from the bondage of the church's laws and rituals.

- In summery:
  - Luther did not write any major work of theology, but mostly responded to controversies with his writings.
  - Luther's two Catechisms were the only systematic presentations of his faith, but they were more pastoral than academic in nature.
  - Luther's theology of the cross, which he outlined in the Heidelberg Disputation, influenced many modern theologians, such as Jürgen Moltmann.

**Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531)**

- Huldrych Zwingli was a Swiss reformer and humanist:
  - he studied at the universities of Vienna and Basel, and became a parish priest in eastern Switzerland.
  - he was influenced by Erasmus and his call for the reform of the church's morals and theology.
  - he moved to Zurich in 1519, where he preached his reform program from the Great Minster, the main church of the city.
  - he criticized the church's sacramental theology, especially the doctrine of Christ's presence at the Eucharist, which he rejected as unbiblical.
  - he was important for spreading the Reformation in eastern Switzerland, but he was not as creative or systematic as Luther or Calvin.
  - Zwingli's forename has different spellings, such as "Ulrich" or "Huldreich", besides "Huldrych".

**John Calvin (1509–64)**

- John Calvin was a French reformer and humanist.
  - he was born in Noyon, near Paris, in 1509, and studied at the universities of Paris and Orléans, where he learned scholasticism and humanism.
  - he had a conversion experience in his mid-twenties, and became involved with the reform movements in Paris, but he had to flee to Basel because of persecution.
  - he settled in Geneva, which had become a Protestant city, in 1535, and made it the center of a global movement that was named after him. Calvinism is a major intellectual and religious force in history.
  - he saw the need for a work that would explain and defend the basic ideas of evangelical theology, based on Scripture and against Catholic criticism.
  - he published a small work called Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536, which had only six chapters.
  - he revised and expanded his work for the next 25 years, until it had 80 chapters and four books in its final edition in 1559.
  - Calvin's work became one of the most important religious works of the sixteenth century.
