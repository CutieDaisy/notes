**Introduction**
The Reformation era was a time of great theological creativity in Christianity according to the text. It mentions three theologians who were very influential: Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli. However, it says that Luther and Calvin were more important than Zwingli, because they had more original ideas and more impact on theology.

**Martin Luther (1483–1546)**

- Luther studied arts and theology at the University of Erfurt and became a professor of biblical studies at the University of Wittenberg.
- Luther lectured on several books of the Bible, such as the Psalms, Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews, between 1513 and 1518.
- Luther developed his doctrine of justification by faith alone, which challenged the prevailing theological views of his time and led him to propose reforms for the church.

- > There were a couple of events that made Luther a public figure and a theological reformer in 1517-1520.
- Some of them are:

  - Luther published his “Ninety-five Theses” on indulgences, which criticized the church for selling pardons for sins.
  - Luther debated with a scholastic theologian at the Leipzig Disputation, where he rejected the authority of the pope and the church councils.
  - Luther wrote three treatises that called for the reform of the church based on the New Testament. He used clear and lively German to appeal to the common people.

- Some further works of Martin Luther:

  - Luther wrote The Babylonian Captivity of the Christian Church, where he argued that the gospel was enslaved by the church's system of priests and sacraments.
  - He also wrote The Liberty of a Christian, where he explained how the doctrine of justification by faith freed Christians from the bondage of the church's laws and rituals.

- In summery:
  - Luther did not write any major work of theology, but mostly responded to controversies with his writings.
  - Luther's two Catechisms were the only systematic presentations of his faith, but they were more pastoral than academic in nature.
  - Luther's theology of the cross, which he outlined in the Heidelberg Disputation, influenced many modern theologians, such as Jürgen Moltmann.

**Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531)**

- Huldrych Zwingli was a Swiss reformer and humanist:
  - he studied at the universities of Vienna and Basel, and became a parish priest in eastern Switzerland.
  - he was influenced by Erasmus and his call for the reform of the church's morals and theology.
  - he moved to Zurich in 1519, where he preached his reform program from the Great Minster, the main church of the city.
  - he criticized the church's sacramental theology, especially the doctrine of Christ's presence at the Eucharist, which he rejected as unbiblical.
  - he was important for spreading the Reformation in eastern Switzerland, but he was not as creative or systematic as Luther or Calvin.
  - Zwingli's forename has different spellings, such as "Ulrich" or "Huldreich", besides "Huldrych".

**John Calvin (1509–64)**

- John Calvin was a French reformer and humanist.
  - he was born in Noyon, near Paris, in 1509, and studied at the universities of Paris and Orléans, where he learned scholasticism and humanism.
  - he had a conversion experience in his mid-twenties, and became involved with the reform movements in Paris, but he had to flee to Basel because of persecution.
  - he settled in Geneva, which had become a Protestant city, in 1535, and made it the center of a global movement that was named after him. Calvinism is a major intellectual and religious force in history.
  - he saw the need for a work that would explain and defend the basic ideas of evangelical theology, based on Scripture and against Catholic criticism.
  - he published a small work called Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536, which had only six chapters.
  - he revised and expanded his work for the next 25 years, until it had 80 chapters and four books in its final edition in 1559.
  - Calvin's work became one of the most important religious works of the sixteenth century.

**Teresa of Avilà (1515–82)**

- Teresa of Avilà was a Spanish mystic and Carmelite nun.
  - She represents a different approach to theology than most of the writers in this chapter, which is called "mystical theology" or spirituality.
  - Her theology is about a personal relationship with God, which cannot be fully expressed in human words, but is based on a trinitarian framework.
  - her most famous work is The Interior Castle of the Soul, which uses the image of a journey through the rooms of a castle to describe the stages of prayer and intimacy with God.
  - Teresa was the first woman to be declared a "doctor of the church" by the pope in 1970, which means she is recognized as an authoritative teacher of the faith.

**Theodore Beza (1519–1605)**

- Beza was a Calvinist writer and professor of theology at Geneva.
  - Beza wrote three volumes of Theological Treatises, which presented a rational and logical account of Reformed theology, based on Calvin's ideas and Aristotelian logic.
  - Beza clarified some of the tensions and ambiguities in Calvin's theology, especially on the doctrines of predestination and atonement, which deal with God's plan and action for human salvation.
  - Beza's concern for logical clarity has been criticized by some writers, who think that he misrepresented or distorted Calvin's theology at some points. Others have defended Beza, saying that he only simplified and improved Calvin's theology.

**Roberto Bellarmine (1542–1621)**

- Roberto Bellarmine was a Catholic theologian and cardinal who defended the Catholic faith against Protestant critics.
  - he joined the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1560, and became a professor of controversial theology at Rome in 1576.
  - he wrote his most important work, Disputations Concerning the Controversies of the Christian Faith, between 1586 and 1593, in which he argued for the rationality of Catholic theology against Lutheran and Calvinist objections.
  - he became a cardinal in 1599, and was one of the most influential Catholic theologians of his time.

**Johann Gerhard (1582–1637)**

- Gerhard was a Lutheran orthodox theologian and professor of theology at Jena.
  - he was appointed professor of theology at Jena in 1616, and he wrote a systematic presentation of Lutheran theology against Calvinist opposition.
  - he followed the tradition of Melanchthon, who wrote the first Lutheran work of theology, Loci communes, in 1521, which treated subjects topically, rather than systematically.
  - he used more Aristotelian logic in his Theological Commonplaces, which he wrote between 1610 and 1622, and which became a classic of Lutheran theology.
