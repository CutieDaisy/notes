## Works of Systematic Theology

- We will be looking at some of the first works of systematic theology of the Reformation, written by people like Philip Melanchthon, who was a Lutheran reformer.

  - Melanchthon published his Loci communes ("Commonplaces") in 1521, which filled the gap for a systematic presentation of the theology of the Reformation.
  - his work treated a number of subjects that were relevant to the Lutheran Reformation, such as the doctrine of justification by faith.

  Here is a possible summary of the text with bullet points:

- There were however some limitations to Melanchthon's work, the _Loci communes_, as a systematic work of theology.

  - Because of that, he expanded his work over time, to address new issues and meet the demands of his readers, but he did not organize the material well.
  - His work became clumsy and disorganized, and could not achieve the systematic analysis needed for the theological debates of his time.
  - Eventually, Calvin developed a system which surpassed Melanchthon's approach to systematic theology and it was more organized and coherent.

- Calvin's systematic work he developed was called _Institutes of the Christian Religion_

  - It was first published in 1536, and was modeled on Luther's work "Lesser Catechism",
  - the "Lesser Catechism" was a short educational work of the German Reformation. It had six chapters, covering the basic topics of the Christian faith.
  - Calvin's work was revised and expanded in 1539, when Calvin was in Strasbourg, and was published in Latin. It had 17 chapters, and was about three times as long as the first edition. It added new material on the knowledge of God and human nature, the Trinity, the Old and New Testaments, penitence, justification by faith, providence and predestination, and the Christian life.
  - the work changed from being a catechism to being a definitive statement of the Christian faith, comparable to Thomas Aquinas' Summa theologiae.

- The text is about the development and content of Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, a major work of systematic theology of the Reformation.
- Some of the main points are:

  - The _Institutes of the Christian Religion_ was expanded and revised in later editions, until it had 80 chapters in the final edition of 1559, compared to the original six chapters of 1536.
  - It was further divided into four books, which dealt with

  * the knowledge of God the creator,
  * the knowledge of God the redeemer,
  * the manner of participation in the grace of Jesus Christ, and
  * the external means or aids which God uses to bring us to Jesus Christ.

  - Calvin's work may have adapted a similar (the fourfold) structure from Peter Lombard's work, the _Four Books of the Sentences_. It is plaussible he may have intended his work to be the Protestant successor to Lombard's work.
  - The _Institutes of the Christian Religion_ by Calvin became the most influential theological work of the Protestant Reformation, surpassing the works of Luther, Melanchthon, and Zwingli.

- So we have looked at how systematic theology began to be developed with the Protestant circle during the reformation era. Similarly, some form of works of systematic theology began to be developed within Catholicism as well.
- Some of the main points are:
  - Many Catholic writers used the form of loci or theological topics, which was originally introduced by Melanchthon,( a Protestant writer), to present and defend Catholic ideas against Protestant ones.
  - One Melchior Cano, a Spanish Dominican theologian, was the first to use this form in his Theological Commonplaces, which was published in 1563 and went into 26 editions in different countries.
  - Many other writers followed Cano's example and produced works using the same format, such as Seraphimus Ractius and Petrus de Lorca.

Finally

- Most observers view Catholic theology as being primarily concerned to
  refute Protestantism at this time.

- they point out Roberto Bellarmine for developing controversial theology to the point at which it virtually became a form of art.

- His most famous work _Disputations Concerning the Controversies of the Christian Faith against the Heretics of this Age_, was first published in 1586
