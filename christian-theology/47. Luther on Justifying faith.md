1. **Faith Alone Justifies**:
   - Luther's central claim is that **faith alone** justifies a person in the eyes of God.
   - This justification occurs when someone believes in Christ as a result of hearing the gospel.
   - Faith affects the **imputation of Christ's righteousness**, covering the believer's sins².

2. **Understanding Faith**:
   - Faith is not merely historical knowledge.
   - It involves **believing and trusting** that Christ was born "for us" and accomplished salvation.
   - True Christian faith goes beyond facts; it's about personal trust in Christ's work.

3. **Faith as Trust (Fiducia)**:
   - Faith is more than intellectual belief; it's **preparedness to act** based on that belief.
   - Analogously, faith isn't just acknowledging a ship's existence; it's stepping into it and entrusting oneself to it.

4. **Faith Unites with Christ**:
   - Luther emphasized the relational aspect of faith.
   - It's not mere assent to doctrines but a **union between Christ and the believer**.
   - Faith makes Christ's benefits (forgiveness, justification, hope) available to the believer.

5. **God's Role in Justification**:
   - The doctrine of justification by faith doesn't mean the sinner is justified because of their belief.
   - God provides everything necessary for justification; humans receive it passively.
   - The phrase "justification by grace through faith" clarifies that God's grace is the basis of justification¹³.
