**Faith Alone Justifies**:
   - Luther's central claim is that **faith alone** justifies a person.
   - We are quite familiar with the term justification, but what does "by faith alone" mean?
   - According to Martin Luther, the assertion that faith alone justifies is often misunderstood due to a lack of understanding of the concept of faith. Luther emphasized the need to closely examine this seemingly simple word. 


   - Let's look at his three key points regarding faith.
1. **Faith Beyond Historical Knowledge**:
   - Luther emphasized that faith is more than mere historical knowledge. Believing in the historical reliability of the gospels isn't enough for justification.
   - Sinners can acknowledge the factual details of the gospels, but true Christian faith goes beyond this. It involves trusting that Christ was born "pro nobis" (for us) and accomplished our salvationÂ¹.

2. **Faith as Trust (Fiducia)**:
   - Luther viewed faith as trust (fiducia). It's not just intellectual assent to truth; it's readiness to act based on that belief and reliance upon it.
   - An analogy is that Faith isn't merely believing a ship exists; it's stepping into it, entrusting ourselves to it.

3. **Faith Unites Believers with Christ**:
   - In his 1520 work, "The Liberty of a Christian," Luther emphasized the relational aspect of faith.
   - Faith isn't merely assenting to abstract doctrines; it's a union between Christ and the believer.
   - Philip Melanchthon, Luther's colleague, aptly put it: "To know Christ is to know his benefits." Faith grants access to Christ's forgiveness, justification, and hope.
Summary:
Luther's insights transformed theology, emphasizing grace, trust, and union with Christ. His legacy reverberates through Reformation thought, inspiring later theologians like Calvin.
