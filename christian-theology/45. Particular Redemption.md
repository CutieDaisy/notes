### Particular Redemption

1. **Definition**:

   - It is also known as “definite redemption” or “effective atonement”, or “limited atonement.”
   - It asserts that Christ's atonement was limited in scope and aimed specifically and only at the elect.
   - Hence Jesus did not atone for the sins of everyone

2. **Basis**:

   - The doctrine is heavily rooted in Reformed theology and associated with predestination.
   - It historical origins trace back to the writings of Godescalc of Orbais in the ninth century.
   - Godescalc argued that if Christ died for all but not all are saved, His death would be ineffective for the unsaved.

3. **Implications**:

   - This raises grave questions concerning the efficacy of Christ's death.
   - But if Christ died only for those who are to be saved, he will have succeeded in his mission.
   - Therefore Christ died only for those who are to be saved.

4. **Related Arguments**:

   - Related line of arguments emerged during the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
   - Primarily associated with Puritan circles.
   - Key points:
     i Christ's death was specifically for the elect.
     ii While His atonement is sufficient for all, it is effective only for the elect.
     iii Christ's work was purposeful and not in vain; everyone for whom He died is saved.

5. **Critiques and Tensions**:

   - The Logical coherence is that :
     - The doctrine aligns with predestination and the sovereignty of God.
   - But the Critics argue that it compromises the New Testament's emphasis on God's universal love and redemption.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The conclusion here is that Salvation and grace are closely linked and predestination plays a significant role in this relation
