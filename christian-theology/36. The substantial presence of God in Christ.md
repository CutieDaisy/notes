## The substantial presence of God in Christ

Key areas the early church has applied this theme:
**Key Points:**

- **Divine Incarnation**: The Alexandrian school's doctrine of the incarnation posits that Christ embodies both divine and human natures.
- **Mary as Theotokos**: Early Christian writers called Mary "Theotokos," meaning "God-bearer," to affirm the union of divine and human in Christ.
- **Controversy with Gnosticism**: The substantial presence of God in Christ countered Gnostic beliefs that deemed matter evil and salvation purely spiritual.
- **Eucharistic Symbolism**: Irenaeus linked the substantial presence of God in Christ to the Eucharist, where the bread and wine symbolize Christ's body and blood.
- **Salvation as Deification**: Simeon the New Theologian emphasized the deification of humans through the union with God's nature, reflecting a unity of opposites.
- **Iconography in Byzantine Theology**: The substantial presence of God in Christ justified the use of icons, despite resistance from those emphasizing God's ineffability.
- **Defense of Icons**: Figures like Germanus and John of Damascus defended icon veneration, arguing that icons represent God's visible form in the material world.
- **Iconoclastic Controversy**: The iconoclasts opposed icon veneration, viewing it as a limitation on God's indescribable nature, a debate still present in Orthodox spirituality.
