## Postmodernism and a new theological agenda

There about 5 features of Postmodernism discussed in the section, namely :
- That it rejects absolutes, certainties, and foundations
- it celebrates pluralism, divergence, and the situatedness of human thought
- it is a reaction against the Enlightenment's totalization
- it is hard to define because modernity is also a contested notion
- it abandons centralizing narratives

So ultimately we can say that a postmodernist view of language and meaning or truth in general is
- relati-vistic or plura-listic
- it focuses on the signifier rather than the signified
- it acknowledges the arbitrariness and interdependence of linguistic signs
- it denies fixed, absolute meanings


Now according to De Saussure's and his theory of signs.
- A sign has three parts: the signifier, the signified, and their unity
- The signifier is the sound of the words, the signified is the meaning of the words, and their unity is a cultural convention
- The relation between signifier and signified is arbitrary, not universal or transcendent
- Also, the relation between signifier and signified depends on cultural conditioning


Continuing on De Saussure's thought, writing like Michel Foucault (1926–84), Jean Baudrillard (1929–2007), and Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) argued that :

- language was arbitrary, whimsical, and capricious
- Language was not based on any absolute linguistic laws, and could not reveal meaning
- Modern society was trapped in artificial sign systems, which meant nothing, and reinforced the ideologies of their creators

- There is an aspect of Postmodernism which is obsessed with texts and language - it is called _Deconstruction_
Deconstruction has two approaches:
    - It rejects the author's identity and intentions
    - It argues that texts have unintended meanings and that authors cannot express what they mean

- Deconstruction is influenced by Jacques Derrida's reading of Martin Heidegger

**Deconstruction's take on Meaning**:
- Within the Deconstruction narrative, all interpretations are equally valid or meaningless
- Meaning is a fascist concept according to Paul de Man 
- Deconstruction rejected metanarratives as authoritarian and imposing

- Post-Vietnam America saw the rise of deconstruction


**Postmodernist turned their attension to biblical interpretation**.
- Traditional biblical interpretation used what is called the historico-critical method
- This method applied critical historical methods such as _the Sitz im Leben_, or “situation
in life,” approach to understand the context of biblical passages
- But some literary critics of the 1980s – such as Frank Kermode and Harold Bloom challenged this method as “institutionally legitimized” or “scholarly respectable”
- Postmodernism questioned the notion of a fixed meaning to a biblical text
- However, the notion of an “interpretive community,” introduced by Stanley Fish, has important implications for biblical interpretation


- Also Postmodernism's take on systematic theology
- Postmodernism by nature is hostile to systematization and meaning
- Mark Taylor's study _Erring_ is an example of postmodernist theology
- Taylor develops an antisystematic theology that explores polyvalent approaches to truth or meaning
- He follows Nietzsche's declaration of the death of God
- He argues for the elimination of self, truth, and meaning
- He claims that language does not refer to anything, and truth does not correspond to anything
