## The third quest of the historical Jesus

- **Emergence**: The "third quest" refers to a series of works that re-evaluate the historical Jesus following the collapse of the "new quest" in the 1960s.
- **Diversity**: Scholars within this group do not share enough commonalities to be categorized uniformly, leading to debates about the term's appropriateness.
- **Sources**: Some scholars appeal to sources outside the New Testament, like the Coptic Gospel of Thomas, while others focus solely on New Testament materials, particularly the synoptic gospels.
- **Acceptance**: Despite reservations, the term "third quest" is gaining acceptance and is included in scholarly surveys.
- **Common Elements**: A key aspect of this quest is an emphasis on Jesus' Jewish identity and the importance of understanding him within the context of first-century Judaism and the social world of first-century Palestine.

The "third quest" for the historical Jesus is characterized by a focus on understanding Jesus within his Jewish context, emphasizing his role and goals as a Jewish figure. This approach is distinct from the "original quest," which sought to separate the historical Jesus from the theological interpretations of later Christian traditions, and the "new quest," which focused on the continuity between Jesus' teachings and those of the early Christian church.

Here are some key contributions from scholars associated with the "third quest":

1. **John Dominic Crossan** suggests that Jesus was a poor Jewish peasant with a radical social message, challenging the power structures of his time⁴.
2. **Marcus L. Borg** views Jesus as a subversive sage who aimed to renew Judaism in a way that posed a significant challenge to the temple elite⁸.
3. **Burton L. Mack** presents Jesus as an individualistic sage, akin to a Cynic, who was more concerned with mocking societal conventions than with specific Jewish issues.
4. **E. P. Sanders** sees Jesus as a prophetic figure focused on the restoration of Israel, envisioning an eschatological transformation.
5. **N. T. Wright** offers a critical appropriation of Sanders' approach while emphasizing that Jesus introduced something radically new, especially concerning the identity of God's people.
