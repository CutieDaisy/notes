1. **Dependence on God's Grace:**

   - One of Augustine‚Äôs favorite biblical texts was John 15: 5: ‚Äúapart from me you can do nothing.‚Äù
   - Augustine believed that humanity's salvation relies entirely on God's grace.
   - He drew a clear distinction between natural human faculties and the additional and special gifts of grace.

2. **Human Nature's Weakness:**

   - According to Augustine, Human nature is inherently weak, lost, and in need of divine assistance for restoration which was due to original sin, committed by free will.

3. **God's Generous Grace:**

   - Augustine believed that Grace is God's unmerited attention to humanity.
   - It is not bestowed as a reward for merits but given freely.

4. **Quoting Augustine:**

   - In his anti-Pelagian work "On Nature and Grace," Augustine emphasized:
     - Human nature was originally blameless but became weakened due to original sin.
     - Christ's grace allows both infants and adults to be saved without earning it through merits . üåü

5. **Two Understandings of Grace:**

   - Pelagius also had his own different understanding and interpretation of grace. This can be divided into two parts.

   * First:

   - **Natural Human Faculties:**
     - He saw grace as the natural human faculties graciously given by God.
     - These faculties (reason and will) were not corrupted or compromised.
     - Through grace, humanity could choose to be sinless by using these faculties.

   * Second:

   - **External Enlightenment:**
     - Pelagius understood grace as external enlightenment or instruction.
     - God provides specific guidance (e.g., Ten Commandments, Christ's example).
     - Grace informs moral duties but doesn't directly assist in performing them.
     - God create humanity and left them to themselves after providing the necessary information to chose between right and wrong

6. **Augustine's Perspective:**

   - **Divine Assistance:**
     - Augustine disagreed, emphasizing grace as divine assistance to humanity.
     - He points to the New Testament as envisioning grace as active help, not just moral guidance.
     - Grace was the real presence of God in Christ within believers.

7. **Augustine's View:**

   - **Creation and Fall:**
     - Humanity was initially created good by God.
     - However, humans fell away from God due to sin.
   - **God's Grace:**
     - God's grace rescues fallen humanity.
     - It heals, enlightens, strengthens, and renews the human soul.

8. **Pelagius's View:**
   - **Human Agency:**
     - Humanity needed guidance but could achieve it unaided.



## The Basis of Salvation

1. **Grace-Based Justification**:
   - Augustine believed that justification is an act of grace.
   - Human good works are a result of God's work within fallen human nature.
   - Salvation is a free and unmerited gift from God, given out of love for sinners.
   - Through Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, God provides what humanity does not deserve (salvation) and withholds what it does deserve (condemnation).

2. **Parable of the Laborers**:
   - Whereas Pelagius argued for merit-based rewards, Augustine analyzing the parable of the labourers in the vineyard of Matthew 20:1-16, highlighted the importance of God's promise.
   - Despite unequal work periods, all laborers received the same wage (a denarius) based on the owner's promise.
   - Augustine concluded that justification of sinners relies on God's gracious promises received through faith, not human merit.

3. **Merit-Based Justification**:
   - Pelagius on the other hand believed that humanity is justified based on individual merits.
   - Good works which secure salvation result from autonomous human free will.
   - Fulfilling God's obligation is essential; failure risks eternal punishment.
   - Jesus Christ's role in salvation is to reveal God's requirements through actions and teaching.

4. **Salvation in Christ**:
   - We can then conclude that Pelagius associated "salvation in Christ" with imitating Christ's example.
   - Pelagianism contrasts sharply with Augustinianism.
   - Augustinianism emphasizes dependence on God's grace, while Pelagianism highlights human freedom and moral responsibility.

## Conclusion
The Pelagian controversy clearly raised the issue of the relation of grace
and merit, which was discussed at some length in the Augustinian revival of
the Middle Ages. Some of the issues which arose will be discussed in our next week (next session)
