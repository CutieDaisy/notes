## Questing for the Historical Jesus

This is a summary of the thesis regarding the the so called discrepancy between the historical Jesus and the New Testament interpretation, as developed by English Deism and the German Enlightenment:

- **Thesis**: Both English Deism and the German Enlightenment proposed that there existed a significant gap between the real historical Jesus and the portrayal of Jesus in the New Testament.
- **Key Points**:
    - The New Testament depicted Jesus as a supernatural redeemer, but Enlightenment rationalism found this idea unacceptable.
    - Instead, Enlightenment thinkers were more receptive to the concept of Jesus as an enlightened moral teacher.
    - Reimarus, in particular, rigorously explored the possibility of uncovering a simpler, more human Jesus behind the New Testament accounts.
    - This quest aimed to discover a credible "Jesus of history" who aligned with the spirit of the age¹².

Although this quest would ultimately end in failure, the later
Enlightenment regarded it as holding the key to the credibility of Jesus
within the context of a rational natural religion. Jesus’s moral authority
resided in the quality of his teaching and religious personality, rather than in
the unacceptable orthodox suggestion that he was God incarnate. And it is
this suggestion that underlies the celebrated “quest of the historical Jesus.”

**The original quest of the historical Jesus**
- **Thesis**: The original quest for the historical Jesus was based on the belief that there existed a significant gap between the historical Jesus and the interpretation imposed by the Christian church.
- **Key Points**:
    - The "historical Jesus" behind the New Testament was seen as a simple religious teacher, while the "Christ of faith" was considered a misrepresentation created by early church writers.
    - The goal of this quest was to strip away unnecessary and inappropriate dogmatic additions (such as the resurrection or the divinity of Christ) and reveal a more credible version of Christianity.
    - English Deists of the seventeenth century expressed similar ideas, but the classic statements came from Germany in the late eighteenth century.
    - Hermann Samuel Reimarus, a key figure, believed that both Judaism and Christianity were built on fraudulent foundations.
    - Reimarus intended to write a major work titled "An Apology for the Rational Worshipper of God," which would expose these facts. However, he never published it, and the manuscript remained unpublished until his death¹³.


- **The Wolfenbüttel Fragments**:
    - At some point, the manuscript fell into the hands of Lessing, who decided to publish a selection of extracts from the work.
    - These "fragments of an unknown writer" were published in 1774 and caused a sensation.
    - The volume contained five fragments, now commonly referred to as the "Wolfenbüttel Fragments."
    - One of these fragments included a sustained attack on the historicity of the resurrection¹.

- **Fragment: "On the Aims of Jesus and His Disciples"**:
    - This fragment concerned the nature of our knowledge of Jesus Christ.
    - Reimarus argued that there was a radical difference between the beliefs and intentions of Jesus himself and those of the apostolic church.
    - According to Reimarus:
        - Jesus's language and images of God reflected a Jewish apocalyptic visionary perspective.
        - Jesus accepted the late Jewish expectation of a Messiah who would deliver his people from Roman occupation.
        - Jesus believed that God would assist him in this task.
        - His cry of dereliction on the cross represented his realization that he had been deluded and mistaken.
    - However, the disciples were not prepared to accept this view:
        - They invented the idea of "spiritual redemption" to replace Jesus's concrete political vision of a liberated Israel.
        - They invented the idea of Jesus's resurrection to cover up the embarrassment caused by his death.
        - As a result, they introduced doctrines unknown to Jesus, such as his death as an atonement for human sin, altering the biblical text to align with their beliefs.
        - Consequently, the New Testament contains fraudulent interpolations, concealing the real historical Jesus behind a fictitious Christ of faith¹.




**The quest for the religious personality of Jesus**

- **Rise of Liberal Protestantism**:
    - **Context**: Liberal Protestantism emerged in the 19th century as a response to the need to adapt Christianity to a modern intellectual context.
    - **Key Points**:
        - Rationalism, which had been prominent during the Enlightenment, was increasingly seen as outmoded due to the influence of movements like Romanticism.
        - A new interest developed in "the human spirit" and the more specifically religious aspects of human life.
        - Liberal theologians began to focus on the religious personality of Jesus, moving away from traditional views of Christ's divinity.
        - Instead of emphasizing abstract doctrines, the idea of a "religious personality" of Jesus—one that could be imitated by anyone—became more acceptable in the modern period.


- **Renewed Attention to New Testament Sources**:
    - Scholars in the nineteenth century turned their focus to the New Testament as they sought to construct a more accurate picture of the historical Jesus.
    - The literary approach to the New Testament, especially the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), was believed to allow for a lifelike portrait of Jesus.
    - The goal was to bring out Jesus's personality clearly through conscientious historical inquiry.

- **The "Life of Jesus" Movement**:
    - The movement centered around the idea that the remarkable religious personality of Jesus, discernible through historical investigation, would provide a solid foundation for Christian faith.
    - Unlike traditional Christology, which often relied on supernatural or antirational elements, this approach emphasized the historical truth of Jesus's personality.
    - The impression Jesus made on his contemporaries could be replicated in his followers across different ages.

- **Proliferation of "Lives of Jesus"**:
    - Numerous "lives of Jesus" were produced during the later nineteenth century in various countries, including England, America, France, and Germany.
    - These works aimed to present the religious personality of the "far-off mystic of the Galilean hills" in a contemporary context, free from cultural biases and irrelevant details.
    - The movement sought to establish a basis of faith for future generations by rediscovering the historical Jesus.

- **Subjectivity and Relativity**:
    - Despite their intentions, portrayals of Jesus's religious personality were inherently subjective.
    - The nineteenth-century scholars, practicing what they believed to be objective historical methods, saw Jesus in a new light.
    - However, their perspective was influenced by the progressive standards of their own time, resulting in an idealized figure rather than an unfiltered historical Jesus.
    - The relativity of historical research was not immediately apparent to them, as they considered themselves objective practitioners.
