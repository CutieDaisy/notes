### Pluralism

## Introduction

- According to Pluralism, all religions including Christianity are distinctive yet equally valid spiritual reality.

- Pluralist writers often use terms like "ultimate reality" or "the Real" to avoid using "God."

- John Hick, a key proponent, argues for a shift from Christ-centered to God-centered understanding.

- Hick likens this shift to a Copernican revolution, emphasizing God at the center with all religions revolving around Him.

- According to Hick, observations show that there is deep devotion and spiritual life in all religions, hence advocating for their equal importance.

## Universal Saving Will & the Kantian Framework

- Hick emphasizes God’s universal saving will, suggesting that all religions lead to the same God.

- Christians do not have exclusive access to God; He is universally available through all religious traditions.

- **Kantian Framework**: Hick uses the Kantian Framework to distinction between ultimate spiritual reality and human perceptions within religious systems :

- In this framework, Kant claims that "The Real" is inaccessible directly and varying human concepts, images, and experiences of the divine inform and shape religious traditions worldwide.

## Challenges with Hick’s Pluralism
- Hick suggests interpreting differences between religions as complementary insights into one divine reality, rather than contradictions.

- For instance, Hick beliefs that different deities like Yahweh, Allah, Krishna, and Shiva represent the divine reality through various cultural lenses.

- These deities are integral to their cultural histories and cannot be extracted from their specific contexts.

- Hick's view raises theological concerns, particularly whether he speaks of the Christian God or adopts a purely theocentric approach.

- Critics argue that setting aside the definitive revelation of God in Jesus Christ undermines a truly Christian perspective.

## Pluralism’s Unresolved Tensions and Alternative Approaches
- Pluralists like Hick are caught up in a tension between arguing for the superiority of their views while rejecting the legitimacy of traditional arguments.

- For instance, pluralists criticize Christian judgments of non-Christian religions but end up critiquing Christians for their beliefs, creating a huge paradox.

- (Alasdair MacIntyre and ) Gavin D’Costa argues that Hick’s pluralism is actually a modern, tradition-specific exclusivism.

- Due to the intellectual untenability of pluralism, An alternative approach, “parallelism,” has developed to avoid the intellectual weaknesses of Hick’s pluralism by adopting a postmodern perspective.

- The relation between Christianity and other religions remains a contentious issue, particularly with the rise of multiculturalism in western society.
