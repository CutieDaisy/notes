- **Theological method in the Reformation**:

- the approaches of Luther and Calvin, are compared with that of Beza
- Luther and Calvin focused on the exposition of Scripture, whiles Beza emphasized the logical arrangement and grounding of theological material - an example is predestination.
- Beza handled the doctrine of predestination differently from Calvin, by using first principles and deductive reasoning, rather than biblical exposition.
- Beza's method influenced the later development of Protestant theology, especially in the areas of scholasticism and orthodoxy.

**Theological Method in the Reformation**

- The Reformation was a movement that challenged the authority and teachings of the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century.
- Reformers such as Luther and Calvin based their theology on the **Scripture**, rather than on the **tradition**, the accumulated teachings of the church.
- Luther and Calvin did not pay much attention to questions of **method**, or how to organize and present their theological ideas. They focused on explaining and applying the Scripture to various issues and situations.
- Calvin's **Institutes** was a work that summarized the main doctrines of the Scripture in a systematic way. It was not based on human reason or logic, but on the biblical text itself.
- Beza was Calvin's successor as the leader of the **Genevan Academy**. He introduced a new concern for method in theology, influenced by the **Renaissance** and **humanism**.
- Beza used reason and logic to arrange and defend his theological ideas, based on certain **first principles** or axioms. He also emphasized the role of **predestination**.

- Scholasticism, which is a method of learning and teaching using logic and reason, rose in different theological circles like Lutherans, Calvinists, and Catholics after the Reformation.
- Due to this, theologians within these circles, wrote vast works of systematic theology, which organized and explained Christian doctrine in a coherent way.
- These works were similar to Thomas Aquinas's Summa theologiae, a medieval masterpiece of scholastic theology.
- These works aimed to present sophisticated and comprehensive accounts of Christian theology, based on the Scripture, reason, and tradition.
- These works also tried to defend their own positions and refute those of their opponents, using arguments and evidence.
