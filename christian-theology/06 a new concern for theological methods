- **Theological method in the Reformation**:

- the approaches of Luther and Calvin, are compared with that of Beza
- Luther and Calvin focused on the exposition of Scripture, whiles Beza emphasized the logical arrangement and grounding of theological material - an example is predestination.
- Beza handled the doctrine of predestination differently from Calvin, by using first principles and deductive reasoning, rather than biblical exposition.
- Beza's method influenced the later development of Protestant theology, especially in the areas of scholasticism and orthodoxy.
