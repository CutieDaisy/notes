### Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer: religion as a human invention

**Origins in Christianity and Dialectical Theology**: Barth (1886–1968) argues that religion is a human creation, often in defiance of God.

**Influence of German Liberal Protestantism**: Educated within this tradition, Barth critiques religion's emphasis on human religiosity.

**Religion as a Tower of Babel**: In his 1916 lecture, he likened human religiosity to the Tower of Babel, constructed against God.

**Radical Discontinuity**: Barth highlights a disconnect between God's self-revelation, leading to faith, and humanity's search for God, leading to religion.

**Criticism of Religion**: Barth aligns with critiques by Feuerbach and Marx, viewing religion as a human invention and an obstacle to discerning God in Christ.

**Idolatry**: At its worst, Barth sees religion as idolatrous, involving the worship of human constructions.

**Misleading Translation**: The phrase “the abolition of religion” as a summary of Barth's view in Church Dogmatics section 17, volume 1, part 2, can be misleading due to translation nuances.

**German Term “Aufhebung”**: The term “abolition” translates the German "Aufhebung," which means both “to remove” and “to exalt,” reflecting an ambiguous philosophical concept.

**Negative Early Views**: Barth initially adopted a negative stance toward religion, seeing it as a human invention that often defied God.

**Not a Critique of Specific Religions**: His critique targeted the general concept of religion, not specific faiths, highlighting how cultural values merge with the gospel.

**German Church Struggle**: His concerns were amplified by the German church struggle in the 1930s, where he saw Germanic ideals infiltrating Christian faith.

**Evolving Perspective**: Over time, Barth acknowledged the need for religion as human institutions or modes of worship, rather than attempts to define God.

Therefore, His term "Aufhebung" is better understood as "transformation" or "sublimation" rather than "abolition."

**Critique and Role of Religion**: Despite its human origins, religion serves a useful role but is contrasted with divine revelation.

**Bonhoeffer's "Religionless Christianity"**: Bonhoeffer analyzed how Christ should be proclaimed in a secular world, advocating for a faith based solely on God's self-revelation, free from traditional religious constructs.

Context of Bonhoeffer's Ideas: His thoughts developed during his imprisonment, rejecting the notion of natural human religiosity and urging theology to move beyond cultural and metaphysical appeals.

Crucified Christ as a Model: Bonhoeffer presented the crucified Christ as a suitable model for a God in the modern world, aligning with new secularism and influencing postwar German Christology and American theology in the 1960s.


## Conclusion
**Confusions in Interpretation**: Both Bonhoeffer's "religionless Christianity" and Barth's "abolition of religion" were often misinterpreted by radical writers.

**Perceived End of Corporate Christian Life**: These phrases were mistakenly understood to signify the end of communal Christian practices and traditional beliefs.

**Popular Misrepresentations**: This misunderstanding was prominent in works like John Robinson's Honest to God and the "death of God" movement in the 1960s.
