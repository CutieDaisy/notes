## Medieval Proofs for the Existence of God
* Thomas Aquinas gives out five lines of argument in support of the existence of God
* Now it should be noted that these arguments are not proofs of God's existence but rather pointers towards the existence of God
* Thomas Aquinas' arguments are all drawn from general human experiences of the world
* The basic line of thought here is that the world mirrors God, in that it is God's creation and just as an artist might sign a painting to identify his work, so God has stamped a divine signature on creation
* Aquinas argues that the way the world is ordered gives the most convincing evidences of God's existence

Argument 1
* Argument from Motion or the Changing Nature of things
    * Why are things moving and changing but not static
    * He notes that, everything that moves is moved by something else meaning for every motion, there is a cause
    * Now each cause of motion must itself have a cause and that cause must have a cause as well.
    * Now since there cannot be an infinite number of causes, Aquinas argues that there must be a single original cause.
    * Hence, Aquinas concludes that this original single cause is God

Argument 2
* Argument from Causation
    * Similar to the 1st argument, Aquinas argues that every event (every effect) has cause and for that matter a single original cause i.e. God

Argument 3
* Argument from Contingent beings.
    * The argument goes like this -  the existence of the universe those not necessitate the existence of humans or animals, therefore the existence of beings is not a matter of necessity. Hence there ought to have been a necessary being to have caused a contigent being i.e. GOD

Argument 4
* Human Values
    * Where do values and ideas like truth, goodness and noblility come from? Aquinas argues that they are caused and originated by God

Argument 5
* the Teleological Argument or Argument form design
    * this argument suggest that natural processes and objects seem to have certain definte objectives in mind - they seem to have a purpose - they seem to have obvious traces of intelligent design. But things don't seem to design themselves: they are caused and designed by someone or something else. Hence from this observation, Aquinas concludes that the source of this design pattern is GOD



* Most of Thomas Aquinas' arguments are rather similar, arguing using 'cause' and 'effect' with a single original cause and ascribing the original cause to GOD,

3 Criticisms of the Aquinas' 5 arguments
* Why is the idea of an infinite regression of causes impossible? the arguments only works if the sequence of causes ends regressively but Aquinas fails to show this point

* Why do these argument lead to belief in only on God?

* The arguments also fails to demonstrate that God continues to exist. Granted an original cause, having caused things to exist does not necessitate the continual existance of the originator

Anselm's ontological argument
* It holds that since the reality of GOd is better the than the mere idea of God, the idea of God as 'that than which nothing greater can be conceived, therefore God exists.
