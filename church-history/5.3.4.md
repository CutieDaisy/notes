## John Paul II and the Collapse of the Soviet Union

**One** _Introduction_

- The Soviet bloc imposed communist control and restricted religious activities in many Catholic parts of eastern Europe.
  The Soviet bloc is a term used to describe the coalition of communist states that were allied with or influenced by the Soviet Union during the Cold War (1947–1991). It included countries in Central and Eastern Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Soviet bloc was also known as the Communist Bloc, the Socialist Bloc, and the Eastern Bloc.

- Western Europe experienced a cultural shift that questioned traditional authority and beliefs, including some Catholic ideas.
- The Second Vatican Council tried to address some of the issues in the west, but also caused some controversies.
- The papacy had little influence over the communist regimes, and was mocked by Stalin for its lack of military power.

**Two** _The uncertainty and surprise of the papal succession in 1978_

- Pope Paul VI, who died in August 1978, was an Italian pope who pursued ecumenism and reform.
- His successor, John Paul I, was also an Italian pope who favored reform, but he died after only 33 days in office.
- His death sparked conspiracy theories, but no evidence of foul play was found.
- The next papal conclave was divided between traditionalists and reformists, and neither side could secure a majority.
- A compromise candidate was needed, who turned out to be the Polish cardinal Karol Wojtyła (Voy-tih-wah).

**Three** _John Paul II, the first Polish pope and a symbol of hope_

- Cardinal Karol Wojtyła was elected in 1978 as a compromise candidate, and chose to honor his predecessor by taking the name John Paul II.
- He was one of the youngest popes in recent history, and was seen as a reformer.
- His election was a shock to the world, especially to Poland, which was under communist control at the time.
- His election boosted the national pride and the Catholic identity of the Polish people, who faced oppression from the communist regime.

**Four** _The rise of the Solidarity union and the collapse of communism in Europe_

- Pope John Paul II visited Poland in 1979 and was greeted by huge crowds of supporters, who felt encouraged and inspired by his presence.
- He supported the formation of Solidarity, the first independent trade union in the Soviet bloc, led by Lech Wałęsa (Lek Vo-wesa).
- He condemned the martial law imposed by the communist authorities in 1981, and continued to advocate for human rights and democracy.
- He witnessed the weakening of the communist system under Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Mikhail Gorbachev was a Soviet and Russian politician who served as the eighth and final leader of the Soviet Union

- He was praised by Gorbachev and others for his role in the collapse of communism, but he did not claim credit for it.
- He argued that communism fell by itself due to its own flaws, and that it was simplistic to say Divine Providence was the cause.

**Five** Challenges and changes in the Catholic world and beyond.

- John Paul II dealt with the decline of Catholicism in the west, and the rise of other Christian movements in the global south.
- He maintained a conservative stance on doctrinal and moral issues, and did not pursue ecumenism with other churches.
- He played a significant role in the end of communism and the transformation of eastern Europe.
