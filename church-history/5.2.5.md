**One** _Introduction_ : _The Catholic Church and the Post-War Period_

- The Catholic Church was aware of the social and cultural changes that were happening in Western Europe after World War II.
- There was a need for theological reconstruction and reformulation to translate the Catholic faith into terms that connected with the new cultural situation.
- However, Pope Pius XII, who was pope from 1939 until his death in 1959, did not believe that there was any pressing need to engage these issues.
- There was no need or mood for reform within the papal establishment.

**Two** _John XXIII and the Ecumenical Council_

- The death of Pius XII led to the election of a new pope, John XXIII, in October 1958.
- John XXIII was expected to be an “interim pope” without any suggestion of major changes.
- Less than three months later, John XXIII announced he would be convening an ecumenical council to formulate the church’s responses to the realities of the post-war world.
- John XXIII spoke frequently of the need to “open the windows of the Church to let in some fresh air.” He expressed the hope that it would be the beginning of a new Pentecost for the church.

**Three** _The Second Vatican Council_

- The 2nd council was held to formulate the church’s responses to the realities of the post-war world.
- More than 2000 bishops and other senior Catholic figures attended.
- The council began its deliberations within the Vatican under John XXIII on October 11, 1962, and closed under Paul VI on December 8, 1965.
- John XXIII died on June 3, 1963, but did in no way affect the council.
- His successor, Paul VI, continued the project.

**Four** _The Motivation of the Council_

- The meeting occurred at a time when Catholicism felt more confident due to events like – John F. Kennedy, a catholic, becoming president of the United States.

- The council's decisions included:
  - Reaffirming the collegiality of bishops, without calling into question the authority or status of the pope, emphasizing their important role in governing and guiding the church.
  - Placing a new emphasis on the role of the laity, encouraging them to become engaged with their social and political context.
  - Acknowledging that other churches were indeed Christian bodies, while noting that they were separated from the Catholic church.

**Five** _The council's openness to other Christians and other faiths_

- The council showed a new spirit of generosity and respect towards other Christian denominations and other religions
- The council acknowledged the Catholic church's role in fostering anti-Jewish prejudice and rejected the idea that Jews were guilty of killing Christ
- The council addressed the Protestant concern about the Catholic view of tradition and the Bible, and affirmed the importance of the Bible for Catholic faith and practice

**Six** _The council's emphasis on the Bible and the liturgy_

- The council declared that the Bible was the Word of God and encouraged biblical scholarship and reading for the church and the believers
- The council urged those who preached and taught the Word to study the Scriptures diligently and regularly
- The council approved a major reform of the liturgy, allowing it to be translated into the local languages of the people
- The council also supported vernacular translations of the Bible, making it more accessible and understandable for the faithful

**Seven** _The council's impact on vernacular biblical translations_

- The council's approval of the use of local languages in the liturgy led to more interest in vernacular biblical translations among Catholics
- The most important vernacular translation was the Jerusalem Bible, which was based on a new French translation by scholars from the École Biblique in Jerusalem
- The Jerusalem Bible was published in French in 1956 and in English in 1966, with the help of J. R. R. Tolkien for the book of Jonah
- The Jerusalem Bible's translation differed significantly from the traditional Catholic Douay-Rheims translation, especially in some key passages such as Luke 1:28
- The Jerusalem Bible's translation raised some questions and concerns among Catholics about the biblical basis of some of their beliefs and practices, such as the Hail Mary

**Eight** _The council's reception and significance_

- The council's reforms were met with resistance and suspicion by some conservative Catholics, especially in Ireland
- Some argued that the council's vision could only be realized by a new generation of bishops who were more open to change and dialogue
- Yet the council was widely seen as a milestone in Catholic history, marking a new way of relating to the world
