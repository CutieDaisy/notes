## Medieval Worldview : Dante's Divine Comedy

Summary
- > The Divine Comedy is a famous poem by Dante Alighieri that describes his journey through Hell, Purgatory and Paradise. He wrote it in the 14th century in Italy. 

- > The peom was originally titled 'Commedia' - meaning 'Drama' in italian
    * Hence the title 'Divine Comedy' doesn't mean a book written for humor but rather a sketch of peoms

- > Now the peom is supposed to be an (imaginative) poetic vission of a way to think about the _world_, _life_ and _death_, and _hell_ and _heaven_. 

- > It was written whiles Dante was in exile due to political persecution

- > The poem is actually made up of 3 peoms which are interconnected
    * Inferno ('Hell')
    * Purgatorio ('Purgatory')
    * Paradiso ('Paradise')

- > Now, in the poem, Dante had three guides: 
    * the 1st was Virgil - Virgil was a Roman poet who he used in the poem to represent human reason,
    * the 2nd guide was Beatrice, a woman Dante loved and who represented divine grace.
    * the 3rd and final guide was Bernard of Clairvaux, a monk and a mystic, who represented contemplation and mystical union with God.

- > Now, Virgil - 'human reason', led him downward hell ('Inferno'), whiles Beatrice ('Divine Grace') led him uphill to 'Purgatory' and Bernard, a representation of contemplation and mystical union with God, led him into the presensce of God ('Paradise')


- > Finally, using the 3rd peom, Paradiso, the text explains some of the   features of Dante's cosmological worldview, such as the spherical Earth, the concentric spheres of the universe, and the role of God as the source of everything, and corrects a common misconception that Christians (people) in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat.
