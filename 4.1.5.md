## The Great Awakening

- The “Great Awakening” was the first of these three religious revivals that took place in North American Protestant Christianity. It occurred in New England in the late 1730s and early 1740s. The phenomenon of the “Awakening” is one of the most distinctive features of North American Protestant Christianity. Each “Awakening” led initially to religious renewal and subsequently to social change.

By 1700, American Protestantism was no longer vibrant.
Church membership began to decline as the spiritual zeal of an earlier generation of Puritans was displaced by the pragmatism of the younger generation.

A series of scandals rocked the credibility of Puritan institutions, like the Salem Witch Trials of 1693, which led to the execution of nineteen people.

In New England in the early 17th century, only people who could properly tell how they became Christians were allowed to join the church fully. But as time went on, it became harder for people to have such a story. Still, many people wanted to be part of the church somehow. This caused a conflict between those who wanted to keep the church pure and strict, and those who thought the church should be more open and flexible to get more members

Some congregations agreed to a middle ground. In 1662, they let people who wanted to followed the church had their kids baptized. This was called a “half-way covenant”. By the early 1700s, most church members were “half-way” or “in name only” Protestants. Protestantism became more like a social and moral code for New England.

The “Great Awakening” changed everything. For about ten years, from 1735 to 1745, a lot of people in New England became more religious. There are records of huge meetings outside, with up to 20 000 people, sermons in the open air, empty bars, and full churches.

Jonathan Edwards (1703–58) was a key figure in this religious awakening. He was the minister of a town in Massachusetts called Northampton, where a lot of people became more religious in the winter of 1734–5. 
The religious awakening spread to other parts of New England, and got a new direction from George Whitfield (1717–70). He had just come from England, where a similar “evangelical revival” (4.1.4) was changing how people practiced their faith.’

Personal conversion became the main way to demonstrate one’s devotion and identity. This resulted in the creation of “conversion narratives” that described one’s experience. Previously, a church would examine someone’s beliefs to see if they were truly converted and orthodox before accepting them as a full member. But now, the individual’s experience mattered more. 

Some scholars suggest that this reduced the intellectual aspect of faith and increased its emotional and relational aspect.

While growing discontent and estrangement from the Christian church preceded the French Revolution, the American Revolution unfolded amid rising religious zeal and devotion.
