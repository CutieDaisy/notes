## The English Reformation

In England just before the Reformation, some bishops and other people were unhappy with the clergy, especially in London. But others liked the clergy in some parts of England and did not want big changes.

Now Luther's writings and ideas began to be debated in England, especially at Cambridge. A group called the Lollardy may have helped with these debates, but Henry VIII was the key to the English Reformation.

Having a son to succeed him as the king of England was Henryâ€™s main concern, and this influenced his decisions and policies, sparking the reformation in England

- Henry's main goal was to have a son who would become the king of England after his death. He had a daughter, Mary Tudor, with his wife Catherine of Aragon, but he wanted a male heir. Also His marriage to Catherine was based on an outdated political alliance with Spain, which become shaky after Charles V (King of Spain) refused to marry his daughter Mary. 
Henry decided to end his marriage to Catherine and look for a new wife but the pope refused to grant him a divorce because he was afraid of upsetting Charles V, who was Catherine's nephew and had a lot of power in Europe. The pope was also under pressure from Charles V's army, which had attacked Rome. Therefore Henry could not get the divorce he wanted.

- Henry tried to persuade the English clergy to accept his authority over the church in England, and have England's independence from the pope. He accused them of being disloyal by supporting Rome, and threatened them with treason. The clergy gave in to some of his demands. When the archbishop of Canterbury died in 1532, Henry appointed Thomas Cranmer, who agreed with Henry's desire to divorce Catherine of Aragon. Cranmer became the archbishop in 1533. By then, Henry had already started a relationship with Anne Boleyn, who was pregnant. Henry needed to end his marriage to Catherine quickly. So an English court declared his marriage to Catherine invalid in 1533, and Anne became the queen. She gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth Tudor, in September. Henry then passed a series of laws in 1534 that confirmed his power over the church and the state. The laws said that Henry's children would inherit the throne, that Henry was the supreme leader of the church in England, and that anyone who denied his supremacy was a traitor punishable by death. Because of these laws, two famous Catholics, Sir Thomas More and John Fisher, were executed for refusing to accept Henry's supremacy.

- Henry angered the pope and other Catholic countries and gave them a reason to attack England. Henry was afraid that France or Spain might try to make England Catholic again by force. To protect his country from this danger, he took money from the monasteries that he closed down, and negotiated with German Lutherans who were also against the pope.

- In short, Henry VIII started the English Reformation because of his political reasons. Henry wanted to make sure that his son would become the king after him, he did not care much about religious ideas, unlike in Germany. However, some people in England liked the new ideas from Luther, and they tried to make them more popular in the church and the society.

- Henry still liked Catholicism even after he broke away from Rome. He did not want to change the church too much. Rather what he did after he became the leader of the church in England was to take money from the monasteries that he closed down.


- Unlike Luther who reformed the church for religious and theological reasons, Henry reformed the church for political reasons to secure his power in England.
