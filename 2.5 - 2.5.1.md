Alright, so, as we have seen, Europe, especially western europe, was plagued with several issues:
Moral issues, Economic downturns, wars and plagues which created serious instability in many regions.

However, at the later part of the 15th century, there was a surge of a new life refered to as the Renaissance:

- The Reneissance was a period of cultural regeneration and renewal beginning at the late fifteenth century.

- It was a period of cultural rebirth which peaked in the 1500s.

- the central theme of the reneissance was that current culture could be renewed by a creative engagement with the legacy of the past cultural.

* Scholars often use the phrase “the Renaissance” to refer to the rise or the injection of new energy and creativity into the church and culture around the time.

* There is also a related term “humanism”, which is widely used to refer to the philosophy of the Renaissance.

* Humanism refers to the underlying ideology of the Renaissance, by which western European culture appeals to its origins in classical Rome and Athens.

* Humanism was a quest for eloquence and excellence, grounded in the application of the wisdom of the classics.

A New Technology : Printing

- So one of the things that aided in the period of the Reneissance was printing

- Now the invention of printing is often compared to the invention of the internet in relation to how they have both changed and shaped cultures

- During this period i.e. the reneissance, the demand for books shot up and copyist couldn't meet the demand, and so there was a need for a faster and more efficient way of making books readily available

- A temporary solution was discovered in the early part of the 15th century. A technic of engraving text and illustrations on wooden blocks using knife and gouge was used with (a water-based) ink. the block was then used to print copies on sheets of paper one at a time

* This was better but still tidious and expensive (because the blocks were costly to produce)

* It was good for printing very short books but highly unrealistic for long ones like the bible

* Later in the 15th century, Johann Gutenburg, who was a german, developed a printing system using the moveable metal type technology

* It was a revolutionary invention that allowed for the mass production of books and other printing materials

* The first book printed & published using Gutenburg's invention was the Gutenburg's Bible

* The tech spread quickly across Europe giving rise to 2 important developments:

  - the lower case letters and
  - the Italic (from the word Italy) lettering

* The advent of the printing press was important on 2 levels

  - One, It made it possible to produce more accurate editions of religious works, like the New Testament or of important writers from the past
  - Two, it had the potential to transmit ideas across national boundaries :
    - John Calvin's for instance had his writtings and ideas travelling across Europe without having to travel himself

* There is therefore no doubt that the invention of the printing press was a major development of western Christianity and also an addition to the Renaissance
