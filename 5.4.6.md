## Virtual Christianity: The Internet and New Patterns of Faith

**One** _How printing technology influenced the spread of religious ideas in Europe_

- Printing technology allowed anyone who could read and afford books to access various religious ideas from different sources (Chapter 2.5.1).
- Governments and churches tried to control the movement of ideas, but books could cross national borders and change people's minds.
- Luther's ideas for instance were widely discussed in Cambridge University during the 1520s, even though he never visited England, all because his books had reached England through the Hanseatic trade route.

**Two** **_A Technological Revolution_**

- The Internet has a transformative potential comparable to printing.
- It was initially a research project by the US Defense Department in the 1970s to link its computers across different military bases.
- But it expanded beyond the control of the US Defense Department, linking many major universities and corporate organizations.
- It became widely available in the mid-1990s, allowing communication and cultural transformation.

**Three** **_The World Wide Web_**

- The Internet is a network of computers that can exchange information
- The World Wide Web is a system that allows web pages to be created and accessed using a simple universal language
- The World Wide Web was invented by Sir Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989
- The World Wide Web has become a medium for people to interact and share information, including religious information
- Christianity has been influenced by the widespread use of the web, as religious leaders and followers can communicate and access resources online

**Four** **_A New Era of Access and Availability for Christian Texts_**

- The Internet is a technology that allows anyone to access information online
- it enables Christians to access the Bible and other Christian texts in multiple languages and translations
- it is comparable to the invention of printing, but also surpasses it in terms of speed, convenience, and diversity
- it reduces the need for physical distribution of Christian texts, especially in regions where they are restricted or persecuted. For instance, Bible-smuggling into China and other parts of the world.
- it offers free or low-cost access to virtual libraries of Christian texts, sponsored by religious charities or organizations

**The Internet: A New Dimension of Community and Worship for Christians**

- The Internet is a technology that allows people to connect and communicate online
- The Internet allows Christians to participate in the worship of a virtual community, by streaming the services of a physical church
- The Internet enables mega-churches to extend their influence and reach to a global audience, by broadcasting their worship and sermons online
- The Internet is a tool for evangelism and outreach, especially for evangelicals who were the first to use it for religious purposes
- The Internet challenges the traditional notion of a gathered community, and raises questions about the nature and quality of online worship

A possible caption and bullet points for the text are:

**The Internet: A Challenge and an Opportunity for Christian Community**

- Christianity is a religion of community, not of isolation. Christians are called to fellowship with each other, and to attend church
- The Internet allows Christians to connect with others online, but also creates the risk of virtual interaction replacing physical encounter and communion
- Some Christian leaders are worried about the impact of the Internet on the church as a community that shapes character, transmits the Christian proclamation, and encourages social identity
- It may create the phenomenon of the solitary worshipper, who only observes but does not participate in church life
- But at the same time, it offers an opportunity for Christians to reach out to others, to share their faith, and to create new forms of community online

**Finally**
- How Christianity will respond to the new situations and challenges discussed in this chapter is yet to be seen. But the religion with the largest number of followers in the world is evidently exploring new frontiers in the twenty-first century.
