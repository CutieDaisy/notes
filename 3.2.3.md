## The Priesthood of All Believers

- So we saw this phrase in one of our earlier discussions with is a quote by Martin Luther.
- the quote was used to strongly oppose the idea that the sole vocation of a christian was to be monk or a monastry priest
- Moreover, the phrase 'The Priesthood of all Believers' spelled out and engrave the idea that every lay person needed to have an exposure somewhat to the original resources of Christianity

- As we have seen with the renaissance, advocating to goback to the patriarchs and origianl sources, Martin Luther's 'Priesthood of all Believers' follows directly in line with this philosophy

- The most critical aspect of this ideology or philosophy is to make religious resources available in the local language, making it accessible to every lay or ordinary person

- Consiquently, the Protestants utilized and emphasized 3 of such resources:

  - the Bible
  - the liturgy (worship)
  - Sermon

  * NB: they emphasize that every believer must have meaningful access to all of these 3

- Luther also declare that the clergy was in no way superior to the layity due to thier ordination which does not confer any special spiritual character and that the clergy are merely laity who have been recognized by other laity of the church to have speicial pastorial or teaching authority amongs them.

- Luther also believes that every christian has the right to interpret the Bible and raise concern about any aspect of the Church's doctrines and practices appearing to be inconsistent with the bible and that the right to read and interpret the Bible is the birthright of all Christians. Therefore the Bible in the lay man's language was essential.

- Moreover making Christian resources available in the local dialect gave more grounds to the Protestant movement. What was eitherto limited only to the elite and learned was now being made readily accessible to the layity touching the heart and minds of the ordinary people.

- Therefore the decision to publish material in the local German language at every level was the hallmark of Protestantism.

- This looks simplistic on the surface but on the contrary, it was life threatening to implement and follow through. In England for example, it was illegal to translate the Bible into English, an offence potentially punishable by death.
  English thus became the language of underground Christians.
  A case in point is John Colet, the then dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, London (1467-1519) - was suspended from his position for translating the Lord's Prayer into English

- Another protestant Calvin, and his decision to produce a French edition of his writings opened the flood gate to religious debates within France, with his writings as resource for those debates on religious and social change

- Willian Tyndale also produces one of the most important early English translation of the New testament.

- These developemnts became alarming to more conservative English Catholics because Tyndale's Translation of the New Testament challenged triditional structures. Many of the references used in the New Testament by the Catholic Church as endorsing the institutional Church were now being challenged by this new translation.

Therefore the use of the vanacular was thus seen as undermining traditional medieval ideas and practices of the church.
