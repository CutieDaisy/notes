Here is a possible summary:

**One:** _Introduction - The impact of World War I on European culture and values_

- The war caused widespread disillusionment and skepticism about the idea of progress and civilization.
- Some thinkers, such as Spengler and Bury, argued that democracy was a sign of decline and that strong leadership was needed.
- Moreover, J. B. Bury also rejected the idea of progress in human history and culture.
- The term "Lost Generation" referred to both the millions of lives lost in the war and the disillusioned writers and artists who emerged after the war.

**Two** _Post-war challenges in western culture and health_

- The cultural heritage of the nineteenth century was seen as collapsing after the war
- The Russian Revolution raised doubts about the future of democracies in Europe
- A flu pandemic, possibly worsened by the war and malnourishment, killed millions of people worldwide

**Three** _Western Christianity after the Great War_

There were some challenges and dilemmas that Western Christianity needed to consider

- Some had hoped to restore international Christian collaboration, whiles others were more pessimistic
- Some also recognized the need for healing and reconciliation after the war.
- Germany faced a crisis of faith and identity as a defeated nation
- German theology faced a crisis of guilt and credibility for supporting Kaiser Wilhelm and militarism.

  - > Many theologians during World War I, had endorsed the war as a divine mission and a just cause, and had justified the German atrocities against civilians and prisoners. After the war, they were confronted with the accusations of war crimes and the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which blamed Germany for starting the war and imposed heavy reparations.

  - > Some theologians tried to defend their position or shift the blame to others, while others admitted their errors and sought a new theological direction. One of the most influential movements that emerged from this crisis was the “theology of crisis”, which was initiated by Karl Barth, a Swiss theologian who had opposed the war from the beginning. Barth argued that human reason and culture were corrupted by sin and could not be trusted as sources of revelation. He emphasized the radical transcendence and sovereignty of God, who could only be known through his Word in Jesus Christ.

  - > The theology of crisis challenged the liberal theology that had dominated German Protestantism before the war, which had stressed the immanence of God in human history and culture, and had tried to harmonize Christianity with modern science, philosophy and ethics. The theology of crisis also influenced other theologians who faced different crises in their contexts, such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who resisted the Nazi regime, and Rudolf Bultmann, who sought to demythologize the biblical message for modern people

**Four** _Barth's theology of crisis and revelation_

- Barth emphasized God's discontinuity with culture and the chasm between God and humanity
- He rejected any natural or cultural basis for knowing God, and affirmed God's self-revelation in Jesus Christ
- Barth influenced other theologians who saw the crisis of European civilization as a divine act
- Barth's theology was situated between an old age that had ended and a new age that had not yet begun

**Five** Caption: Emil Brunner and the theology of crisis in America

- Brunner was a Swiss theologian who followed Barth's approach
- He spoke English and visited the United States in the late 1920s
- Brunner's message of a theology of crisis resonated with American Christians who were facing their own crisis, known as the fundamentalist controversy
