## Women Mystics and Female Religious Orders

- First of all the issue of women status and influence in medieval western Europe is complex.
- And a single topic of gender is not adequate to describe the real issue.
  Therefore the British historian Eileen Power developed about 3 views on the topic

> Views concerning the status of women and thier impact in the Middle Agess

- There is a distinction between medieval ideas about women and the everyday experiences of women
- While medieval women faced some serious challenges - such as a legal system whcih assumed female inferiority, and a social structure that invested men with more power over women, it should be noted that most medieval women found themselves in a position "neither of inferiority nor of superiority, but of a cetain rough-and-ready equality"
- The real issue was not gender, but social class

> Also some important factors that were later discovered to have affected the lives of medieval women included :
- ethnicity, and
- regional identity,

- Now what Eileen's view failed to look at was the life of women in religious orders - women like :
  - > Hildegard of Bingen (1098 - 1178) 
    - She wrote extensively on :
        * work of natural philosophy,
        * theological treatises,
        * accounts of mystical revelations,
        * works of drama, and also
        * letters
    - She was a dramatist, mystic, theologian, musician and correspondent. 

  - > Hadewijch of Brabant (early 13th century),
  - > Mechthild of Magdeburg (1207 - 1282/1294),
  - > Angela of Foligno (1248 - 1309), and
  - > Julian of Norwich (1343 -1416) 
    * she wrote a celebrated book called _Revelations of Divine Love_  

- These women were all mystics who developed an approach to spirituality attracting following across Europe

- Some worked in religious communities, while other women mystics adopted a more solitary life

- The works of these women show how much women achieved through religious orders even though society discouraged their development

- > Who is a mystic?
  - The term mystic generally refers to writers or people with spiritual wisdom
  - Mysticism however means a spiritual approach to deepen the direct human experience of God
  - the term 'mystic' is from the greek 'mystikos' meaning concealed or inaccessible, or being initiated into certain practices.
  - Hence a mystic is one who is recognized as developing methods or ideas that help the believer deepen the direct relationship with God.

- > Leadership
    - For many women including the wealthy and nobles, the religious life offered a degree of independence and leadership roles which was not available in the secular world.
    - Some convent elected their own abbess or prioress and some of them commanded political influence. Example Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim
      * she helped elect King Henry II
      * and also Conrad II as Roman Emperor

    - Others like Philippa of Toulouse helped in the founding of an abbey called Fontevraud 
        - the abbey was a double monastery - monks and nuns lived on the same site
        - it was to always have a woman as the leader. 
        - The same abbey served as a refuge for assaulted women, prostitutes, and a hospital for lepers
    - also women who were widowed (especially from the crusades) formed communities to care for the poor and sick, and for religious devotion. These were known as the Beguines
