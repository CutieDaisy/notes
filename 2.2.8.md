## Women Mystics and Female Religious Orders

- First of all the issue of women status and influence in medival western Europe is complex.
- Also a single topic of gender is not adequate to describe the real issue.
  Therefore the British historian Eileen Power developed about 3 views on the topic

 > Views concerning the status of women and thier impact in the Middle Agess

  - There is a distinction between medieval ideas about women and the everyday experiences of women
  - While medieval women faced some serious challenges - such as a legal system whcih assumed female inferiority, and a social structure that invested men with considerable power over women's lives, it should be noted that most medieval women found themselves in a position "neither of inferiority nor of superiority, but of a cetain rough-and-ready equality"
  - The real issue was not gender, but social class

 > Also some important factors that were later discovered to have affected the lives of medieval women included :
  - ethnicity, and
  - regional identity,

- Now what Eileen's view failed to look at was the life of women in religious orders
