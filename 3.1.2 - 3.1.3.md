## A Changing Social Order
- At this point during the sixteenth century, the idea of the aristocratic social class was being debated and challenged for a new order of social class.

- Now, this new order or ideology was set in motion and it held that individuals could determine their own social status by their own effort.

- the demand for this change increased more in the northern cities of Europe

- and also this gave rise to the mercantile (or the commercial) class.

- This obviously posed a challenge to the power and influence of traditional aristocratic families

- Also the idea that vocation was a call to a monastic life was strongly spoken against by Martin Luther through his doctrine "priesthood of all believers".
  According to Martin Luther Christians were called to serve God actively in the world and its affairs.

- So basically the Protestant ideology gave motivation to the lay to engage in politics, business, finance and other artistic professions

## The Reformation and the Cities of Europe

- In northern Europe, the Reformation was mainly based in cities.

  - Cities like Lyons, Orl√©ans, Paris, Poitiers, Rouen in France; Zurich in Switzerland;
  - and more than 50 (out of 65) imperial cities in Germany

- It will seem that due to the black death and other economical factors, there rose a social unrest in many cites causing a demand for a broader-based government

- therefore, By the late 15th and early 16th century most of these cities regarded themselves as states, or more properly, a city-states with each having a city council as a government.

- Now some of these changes were often linked not just to the demand for economical change but a religious change as well.

- Therefore it is said that the success and failure of the Reformation in the cities (Nuremberg and Strasburg for example) were because of economic, social and political factors

Now let's look briefly at some common features of the Reformation in the various cities:
  - 1, the reformation appears to have been a response to social, economic and political pressure for change.
  - 2, the success of the reformation depended on the city's political aligence and alignment with other cities in terms of military, political and economical aid
  - 3, again the success of the reformation depended on the policies and decisions of the city-council

- Practically therefore the life of the Reformation was directly linked to the city-councils
