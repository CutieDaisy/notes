## The Rise of the Monastic and Cathedral Schools
- > Introdution :
  - It is safe to say that Universities did not exist by the 9th century
  - rather from the 8th to 11th century what existed were schools that were attached to monasteries and cathedrals
  - they became distinct centers of Scholarships
  - and were later developed as Universities

- > Purpose :
  - Traditional Roman education bagan to collapse in the 5th century, to ensure that the clergy were well educated, Bishops created the space and avenue for literacy and basic administrative skills

- > Motivation
  - this was based on their love of learning and the desire to keep scholarship alive
  - it was also to aid in evangelist work and catechism

- > Development :
  1. First, the Cathedrals Schools - (the 1st category of schools)
     - the earliest of Cathedral schools were developed in Spain 6th and 7th century
     - Some of the key Cathedral schools were later developed in England
     - Now As England was converted to Christianity, it became urgently necessary for theological education, giving rise to various Cathedral Schools
     - these schools were initially developed at Canterbury (576) and Rochester (604) in Kent, south of England
     - it is also worth noting that it was Gregory the Great's dicision to send missionaries to England that birthed its (i.e. England's) conversion
     - France followed next with these Cathedral Schools and the Cathedral school of Paris later became the University of Paris in the 12th century
  2. Second category of schools are the Monasteries (the other category of Schools)
     - Some of the monasteries in Europe emerged as centers of scholarship with large libraries
     - there were 3 element of importance in Benedictine spirituality (Benedict of Nursia)
        - liturgical prayer
        - manual labor
        - divine reading (meditative reading) 'lictio divina'
    - the divine reading created a demand for texts of the Bible, which also created the need for the texts to be copied by hand
    - these large copies also created the need for scriptorium - a special room or section of the library dedicated to the copying of manuscripts
    - this built up large libraries of classical historical literature, biblical works and Christian theology
    - During the Carlingian era ( a French era in the 19th century) , monastic libraries were filled with both Christian and Pagan works. Many of the classical works widely referenced today are from the Carolingian period
      - Example, two of the earliest manuscript of Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars are from this period.
