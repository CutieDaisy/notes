## An Age of Revolution: The Long Nineteenth Century in Europe

The section is about the French Revolution and its aftermath in Europe.
It talks about how the revolution began as a result of social, economic, and political discontent in France, and how it led to a series of wars and conflicts with other nations. It also mentions some of the key figures and events of the revolution, such as Napoleon Bonaparte, the Congress of Vienna, and the execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. This section also suggests that the revolution had a lasting impact on the culture, politics, and religion of Europe and beyond.

Napoleon Bonaparte was a famous French general and emperor who rose to power after the French Revolution (1789-1799). He fought many wars against different coalitions of European countries that opposed his ambitious plans to expand French influence and spread revolutionary ideas. These wars are known as the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815) and they involved many battles and campaigns across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Some of the most notable events of these wars were Napoleon's coronation as emperor in 1804, his victory at Austerlitz in 1805, his invasion of Russia in 1812, his defeat at Waterloo in 1815, and his exile to St. Helena. Napoleon's wars had a lasting impact on the political and cultural landscape of Europe and the world.

The aftermath of the wars caused a weakening of the power of autocratic rulers, including the authority of the Catholic church and the guilds.
The ideas of the French Revolution, such as nationalism, liberalism, and meritocracy began to spread. The wars reshaped the map of Europe, creating new states and alliances, and shifting the balance of power among the major powers. Britain emerged as the dominant naval and economic power, while France lost its influence and prestige. Spain and Portugal struggled to keep their colonies in South America, where independence movements led by Simón Bolívar gained momentum. The wars also stimulated cultural, scientific, and technological innovations, as well as social changes and reforms.

The year 1814 marked the return of Louis XVIII to the throne of France and the restoration of Catholicism as the state religion. However, the relationship between the church and the state remained tense and complex throughout most of the 19th century. Despite this, the church experienced some revival and growth, especially in rural areas. One of the signs of this renewal was a series of religious movements known as "le Réveil" (French for "revival" or "awakening"), which affected both western Switzerland and some parts of southeastern France.

The French Revolution and its aftermath had a profound impact on Catholicism, not only in France but also in other parts of Europe and the world. Catholicism was still a predominantly European religion in the early 19th century, concentrated in the territories of the Habsburg Empire, Italy, and France. These regions had been deeply affected by the wars and political upheavals that followed the revolution. Pope Pius VII, who reigned from 1800 to 1823, faced a crisis of how to restore and redefine the status of the Catholic Church in the new European order.

He established the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in 1814, with the aim of rebuilding Catholicism throughout Europe. His Secretary of State, Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, negotiated a series of concordats with various states during the Congress of Vienna (1815), which sought to reestablish peace and stability after the Napoleonic Wars. One of these concordats was with Napoleon himself in 1801, which granted some rights and recognition to Catholicism in France. Another achievement of Consalvi was to persuade the Congress of Vienna to restore the papal states, which were territories in northern Italy under the control of the pope, and which had been annexed by France in the 1790s.

The French Revolution also sparked a cultural and intellectual movement known as Romanticism, which challenged the rationalism and materialism of the Enlightenment. Romanticism emphasized emotion, imagination, individuality, and nature, and was often sympathetic to religious sentiment and expression. Some writers and artists who were influenced by Romanticism defended Catholicism as a source of beauty, inspiration, and tradition. For example, François-René de Chateaubriand wrote The Genius of Christianity (1802), which praised Catholicism for its contribution to literature, art, and civilization. Romanticism also influenced some aspects of Catholic theology and spirituality in the 19th century.

The Napoleonic wars also affected other Christian denominations. The case of Prussia illustrates the new challenges that Christianity faced. After the Council of Vienna, Prussia had to combine its Lutheran and Reformed churches into one. This was a consequence of Napoleon’s victory over Prussia in the battles of Jena and Auerstedt in October 1806. These battles exposed the weaknesses of Prussia’s feudal system of governance and military command. King William III of Prussia initiated a series of reforms to modernize and improve his administration. These reforms had a significant impact on Prussian Protestantism

'Prussia had been mostly Protestant since the 1600s, with two main branches – Lutheran and Reformed (3.5.1). William III wanted to merge the two branches in his territory in 1808. He did this after Napoleon was finally defeated, by creating a Prussian Ministry of Religious, Educational, and Medical Affairs to oversee the region's religious matters. The new merger was called the Evangelical Church in Prussia. Some Lutheran and Reformed congregations kept their original identity, but many joined the merger. William III tried to make the Prussian churches more centralized, which made many Lutherans feel ignored. In the late 1830s, many Prussian Lutherans left for North America and Australia, where they could practice their original practices without the state meddling.

In the next section, we will explore how Christianity faced many challenges and changes in Europe during the nineteenth century. However, we will also see how Christianity strengthened its position in eastern Europe at the same time, as the Ottoman Empire’s influence in the area declined. This was especially evident in the events that occurred in southeastern Europe, where Christianity became more prominent

(Napoleon Bonaparte was a French leader who became emperor after the French Revolution. He fought many wars to spread his power and ideas across Europe and beyond. He won and lost many battles and was eventually exiled after his defeat at Waterloo in 1815. His wars changed Europe and the world.)

(The aftermath of the wars caused a weakening of the power of autocratic rulers, including the authority of the Catholic church and the guilds.
The ideas of the French Revolution, such as nationalism, liberalism, and meritocracy began to spread.
The wars changed Europe’s borders, politics, and power. Britain became stronger, France became weaker, and South America fought for freedom. The wars also inspired new ideas and changes in society.)

(In 1814, France restored the monarchy (Louis XVIII) and Catholicism, but the church and the state had many conflicts. The church grew in some areas and inspired religious movements and revivals like the movement known as "le Réveil" in Switzerland and France.)

(The French Revolution and the wars that followed it changed Catholicism in Europe and the world. The pope, Pius VII from 1800 to 1823, had to deal with the challenge of rebuilding and reshaping the church in a new political situation.)

(The pope created a new office to rebuild Catholicism in Europe. His chief diplomat (Cardinal Ercole Consalvi) made agreements with different states during the Congress of Vienna (1815), including Napoleon, to protect and restore the church’s rights and lands. He also got back the papal states in Italy that France had taken)

(The French Revolution inspired Romanticism, a movement that valued emotion, imagination, and nature over reason and materialism. Some Romantic writers and artists admired Catholicism for its beauty and tradition. Romanticism also affected some Catholic ideas and practices in the 19th century.)

(The Napoleonic wars forced Prussia to unite its Lutheran and Reformed churches. This was because Napoleon defeated Prussia in 1806. The Prussian king reformed his government and army, and also changed his Protestantism.)

(Prussia was mostly Protestant with two branches – Lutheran and Reformed. William III combined them into one church in 1808, called the Evangelical Church in Prussia, after Napoleon lost. He also controlled the churches more, which upset many Lutherans. Some Lutherans left for other countries where they could be free)

(The next section will show how Christianity faced difficulties and changes in Europe in the 1800s. But it will also show how Christianity grew in eastern Europe as the Ottoman Empire weakened. This was clear in southeastern Europe, where Christianity became more important)
