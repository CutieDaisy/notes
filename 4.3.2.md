## The Second Great Awakening and American Revivalism

**One** _Introduction_

- America's population and territory increased significantly between 1800 and the eve of the Civil War

- Some worried that this expansion would erode original Christian values

  - One of the reasons for this concern was that:
     many children left their family homes, creating new communities quite far from their parents

- None the less, many coped with the changes by reaffirming their religious roots and identity

**Two** _Population & Revivalism_

- Protestant church attendance increased tenfold from 1800 to 1860, surpassing population growth

- The main reason for this huge growth was the "Second Great Awakening" (1800-30) and the other forms of religious revivalism it inspired

- Revivalism became the hallmark of American religion and influenced the nation's identity, independence, and democracy

**Three** _The Second Great Awakening_

- The first revival of the Second Great Awakening happened in Kentucky in 1801, attracting thousands of people to camp meetings.

        - An example of these camp meetings is the famous 'Cane Ridge' meetings

- The revival spread throughout various regions, appealing to common people with emotional faith

- The result was the transformation of America before the Civil War, creating the Protestant "Bible Belt"

**Four** _Effects of the Second Great Awakening_

- The second Great Awakening changed the American religious landscape, favoring Baptists and Methodists over Anglicans, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians

- The second Great Awakening also saw the first significant conversions of slaves, who mostly joined Baptists and Methodists, who were more welcoming and emotional than Anglicans

- The second Great Awakening contrasted the emotional appeal of revivalism with the more intellectual approach of Anglican churches

**Five** _Charles Grandison Finney (A Key Figure In The Second Awakening)_ 

- Charles Grandison Finney was a key figure of the Second Awakening who left his law career to become a Presbyterian minister

- Finney rejected some aspects of the old New England Calvinism and focused on the need for people to respond to the gospel and the skills of the preacher to persuade them


**Six** _Finneyâ€™s Method of Revival_

- Finney introduced many features of revivalist preaching, such as the "anxious seat", the "altar call", and the use of persuasion techniques, which influenced later evangelists like Moody, Sunday, and Graham

- Finney's approach to revival was different from the First Great Awakening, as he believed it was not a miracle but the result of using the right means

- Finney's influence was huge, as he shaped the revivalist tradition in America

- De Tocqueville, a French political thinker, visited America in 1831 and was amazed by the religious atmosphere, the diversity of denominations, and the growth of Catholicism

**Seven** _The Holiness Movement and Its Social Reforms in Antebellum America_

- Revivalism influenced the American religious landscape and led to the emergence of the "Holiness Movement" that focused on morality and spirituality

- The Holiness movement supported the abolition of slavery and civil disobedience against the fugitive slave laws

- Oberlin College, where Finney taught theology, was a center of the Holiness movement and also promoted racial and gender equality, coeducation, and women's ordination

**Eight** _The Rise of American Hymnody and the Partnership of Moody and Sankey_

- After the Civil War, revivalism evolved and incorporated popular American hymns, which the Puritans had rejected but the Wesleyans had embraced

- Dwight L. Moody, the greatest revivalist preacher of the late nineteenth century, partnered with musician Ira D. Sankey, who they met at a revival in Indianapolis in 1870

- Moody and Sankey were very effective in promoting faith in a time of social change, and composed some of the most famous hymns of the era, using the verse-chorus model based on popular songs

**Finally**

- European immigration was a factor that changed the American religious and cultural landscape
